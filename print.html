<p>This guide is meant to help document how rustc – the Rust compiler – works,
as well as to help new contributors get involved in rustc development.</p>
<p>There are seven parts to this guide:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="./building/how-to-build-and-run.html">Building <code>rustc</code></a>:
Contains information that should be useful no matter how you are contributing,
about building, debugging, profiling, etc.</li>
<li><a href="./contributing.html">Contributing to <code>rustc</code></a>:
Contains information that should be useful no matter how you are contributing,
about procedures for contribution, using git and Github, stabilizing features, etc.</li>
<li><a href="./part-2-intro.html">High-Level Compiler Architecture</a>:
Discusses the high-level architecture of the compiler and stages of the compile process.</li>
<li><a href="./part-3-intro.html">Source Code Representation</a>:
Describes the process of taking raw source code from the user
and transforming it into various forms that the compiler can work with easily.</li>
<li><a href="./part-4-intro.html">Analysis</a>:
discusses the analyses that the compiler uses to check various properties of the code
and inform later stages of the compile process (e.g., type checking).</li>
<li><a href="./part-5-intro.html">From MIR to Binaries</a>: How linked executable machine code is generated.</li>
<li><a href="./appendix/background.html">Appendices</a> at the end with useful reference information.
There are a few of these with different information, including a glossary.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="constant-change"><a class="header" href="#constant-change">Constant change</a></h3>
<p>Keep in mind that <code>rustc</code> is a real production-quality product,
being worked upon continuously by a sizeable set of contributors.
As such, it has its fair share of codebase churn and technical debt.
In addition, many of the ideas discussed throughout this guide are idealized designs
that are not fully realized yet.
All this makes keeping this guide completely up to date on everything very hard!</p>
<p>The Guide itself is of course open-source as well,
and the sources can be found at the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-dev-guide/">GitHub repository</a>.
If you find any mistakes in the guide, please file an issue about it.
Even better, open a PR with a correction!</p>
<p>If you do contribute to the guide,
please see the corresponding <a href="contributing.html#contributing-to-rustc-dev-guide">subsection on writing documentation in this guide</a>.</p>

<p>This documentation is <em>not</em> intended to be comprehensive; it is meant to be a
quick guide for the most useful things. For more information, <a href="./building/how-to-build-and-run.html">see this
chapter on how to build and run the compiler</a>.</p>
<h2 id="asking-questions"><a class="header" href="#asking-questions">Asking Questions</a></h2>
<p>The compiler team (or <code>t-compiler</code>) usually hangs out in Zulip <a href="https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler">in this
&quot;stream&quot;</a>; it will be easiest to get questions answered there.</p>
<p><strong>Please ask questions!</strong> A lot of people report feeling that they are &quot;wasting
expert time&quot;, but nobody on <code>t-compiler</code> feels this way. Contributors are
important to us.</p>
<p>Also, if you feel comfortable, prefer public topics, as this means others can
see the questions and answers, and perhaps even integrate them back into this
guide :)</p>
<h3 id="experts"><a class="header" href="#experts">Experts</a></h3>
<p>Not all <code>t-compiler</code> members are experts on all parts of <code>rustc</code>; it's a pretty
large project.  To find out who has expertise on different parts of the
compiler, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/blob/master/content/experts/map.toml">consult this &quot;experts map&quot;</a>.</p>
<p>It's not perfectly complete, though, so please also feel free to ask questions
even if you can't figure out who to ping.</p>
<h3 id="etiquette"><a class="header" href="#etiquette">Etiquette</a></h3>
<p>We do ask that you be mindful to include as much useful information as you can
in your question, but we recognize this can be hard if you are unfamiliar with
contributing to Rust.</p>
<p>Just pinging someone without providing any context can be a bit annoying and
just create noise, so we ask that you be mindful of the fact that the
<code>t-compiler</code> folks get a lot of pings in a day.</p>
<h2 id="cloning-and-building"><a class="header" href="#cloning-and-building">Cloning and Building</a></h2>
<h3 id="system-requirements"><a class="header" href="#system-requirements">System Requirements</a></h3>
<p>Internet access is required.</p>
<p>The most notable software requirement is that you will need Python 2 or 3, but
there are various others.</p>
<p>The following hardware is recommended.</p>
<ul>
<li>30GB+ of free disk space.</li>
<li>8GB+ RAM</li>
<li>2+ cores</li>
</ul>
<p>More powerful machines will lead to much faster builds. There are various
strategies to work around lesser hardware in the following chapters.</p>
<p>See <a href="./building/prerequisites.html">this chapter</a> for more details about software and hardware prerequisites.</p>
<h3 id="cloning"><a class="header" href="#cloning">Cloning</a></h3>
<p>You can just do a normal git clone:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">git clone https://github.com/rust-lang/rust.git
cd rust
</code></pre>
<h3 id="xpy-intro"><a class="header" href="#xpy-intro"><code>x.py</code> Intro</a></h3>
<p><code>rustc</code> is a <a href="./building/bootstrapping.html">bootstrapping</a> compiler, which makes it more complex than a
typical Rust program. As a result, you cannot use Cargo to build it. Instead
you must use the special tool <code>x.py</code>. It is used for the things Cargo is
normally used for: building, testing, creating releases, formatting, etc.</p>
<h3 id="configuring-the-compiler"><a class="header" href="#configuring-the-compiler">Configuring the Compiler</a></h3>
<p>In the top level of the repo:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ ./x.py setup
</code></pre>
<p>This will do some initialization and walk you through an interactive setup to
create <code>config.toml</code>, the primary configuration file.</p>
<p>See <a href="./building/how-to-build-and-run.html#create-a-configtoml">this chapter</a> for more info about configuration.</p>
<h3 id="common-xpy-commands"><a class="header" href="#common-xpy-commands">Common <code>x.py</code> commands</a></h3>
<p>Here are the basic invocations of the <code>x.py</code> commands most commonly used when
working on <code>rustc</code>, <code>std</code>, <code>rustdoc</code>, and other tools.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Command</th><th>When to use it</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><code>./x.py check</code></td><td>Quick check to see if most things compile; <a href="./building/suggested.html#configuring-rust-analyzer-for-rustc">rust-analyzer can run this automatically for you</a></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>./x.py build</code></td><td>Builds <code>rustc</code>, <code>std</code>, and <code>rustdoc</code></td></tr>
<tr><td><code>./x.py test</code></td><td>Runs all tests</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>./x.py fmt</code></td><td>Formats all code</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>As written, these commands are reasonable starting points. However, there are
additional options and arguments for each of them that are worth learning for
serious development work. In particular, <code>./x.py build</code> and <code>./x.py test</code>
provide many ways to compile or test a subset of the code, which can save a lot
of time.</p>
<p>Also, note that <code>x.py</code> supports all kinds of path suffixes for <code>compiler</code>, <code>library</code>,
and <code>src/tools</code> directories. So, you can simply run <code>x.py test tidy</code> instead of
<code>x.py test src/tools/tidy</code>. Or, <code>x.py build std</code> instead of <code>x.py build library/std</code>.</p>
<p>See the chapters on <a href="./building/how-to-build-and-run.html">building</a>,
<a href="./tests/intro.html">testing</a>, and <a href="./rustdoc.html">rustdoc</a> for more details.</p>
<h3 id="contributing-code-to-other-rust-projects"><a class="header" href="#contributing-code-to-other-rust-projects">Contributing code to other Rust projects</a></h3>
<p>There are a bunch of other projects that you can contribute to outside of the
<code>rust-lang/rust</code> repo, including <code>clippy</code>, <code>miri</code>, <code>chalk</code>, and many others.</p>
<p>These repos might have their own contributing guidelines and procedures. Many
of them are owned by working groups (e.g. <code>chalk</code> is largely owned by
WG-traits). For more info, see the documentation in those repos' READMEs.</p>
<h3 id="other-ways-to-contribute"><a class="header" href="#other-ways-to-contribute">Other ways to contribute</a></h3>
<p>There are a bunch of other ways you can contribute, especially if you don't
feel comfortable jumping straight into the large <code>rust-lang/rust</code> codebase.</p>
<p>The following tasks are doable without much background knowledge but are
incredibly helpful:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="./notification-groups/cleanup-crew.html">Cleanup crew</a>: find minimal reproductions of ICEs, bisect
regressions, etc. This is a way of helping that saves a ton of time for
others to fix an error later.</li>
<li><a href="./contributing.html#writing-documentation">Writing documentation</a>: if you are feeling a bit more intrepid, you could try
to read a part of the code and write doc comments for it. This will help you
to learn some part of the compiler while also producing a useful artifact!</li>
<li><a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/compiler-team/working-groups/">Working groups</a>: there are a bunch of working groups on a wide variety
of rust-related things.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="contributor-procedures"><a class="header" href="#contributor-procedures">Contributor Procedures</a></h2>
<p>There are some official procedures to know about. This is a tour of the
highlights, but there are a lot more details, which we will link to below.</p>
<h3 id="code-review"><a class="header" href="#code-review">Code Review</a></h3>
<p>When you open a PR on the <code>rust-lang/rust</code> repo, a bot called <code>@rustbot</code> will
automatically assign a reviewer to the PR based on which files you changed.
The reviewer is the person that will approve the PR to be tested and merged.
If you want a specific reviewer (e.g. a team member you've been working with),
you can specifically request them by writing <code>r? @user</code> (e.g. <code>r? @jyn514</code>) in
either the original post or a followup comment
(you can see <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/78133#issuecomment-712692371">this comment</a> for example).</p>
<p>Please note that the reviewers are humans, who for the most part work on <code>rustc</code>
in their free time. This means that they can take some time to respond and review
your PR. It also means that reviewers can miss some PRs that are assigned to them.</p>
<p>To try to move PRs forward, the Triage WG regularly goes through all PRs that
are waiting for review and haven't been discussed for at least 2 weeks. If you
don't get a review within 2 weeks, feel free to ask the Triage WG on
Zulip (<a href="https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/242269-t-release.2Ftriage">#t-release/triage</a>). They have knowledge of when to ping, who might be
on vacation, etc.</p>
<p>The reviewer may request some changes using the GitHub code review interface.
They may also request special procedures (such as a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/crater">crater</a> run; <a href="getting-started.html#breaking-changes">see
below</a>) for some PRs.</p>
<p>When the PR is ready to be merged, the reviewer will issue a command to
<code>@bors</code>, the CI bot. Usually, this is <code>@bors r+</code> or <code>@bors r=user</code> to approve
a PR (there are few other commands, but they are less relevant here).
You can see <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/78133#issuecomment-712726339">this comment</a> for example. This puts the PR in <a href="https://bors.rust-lang.org/queue/rust">bors's queue</a>
to be tested and merged. Be patient; this can take a while and the queue can
sometimes be long. PRs are never merged by hand.</p>
<h3 id="bug-fixes-or-normal-code-changes"><a class="header" href="#bug-fixes-or-normal-code-changes">Bug Fixes or &quot;Normal&quot; code changes</a></h3>
<p>For most PRs, no special procedures are needed. You can just open a PR, and it
will be reviewed, approved, and merged. This includes most bug fixes,
refactorings, and other user-invisible changes. The next few sections talk
about exceptions to this rule.</p>
<p>Also, note that it is perfectly acceptable to open WIP PRs or GitHub <a href="https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/">Draft
PRs</a>. Some people prefer to do this so they can get feedback along the
way or share their code with a collaborator. Others do this so they can utilize
the CI to build and test their PR (e.g. if you are developing on a laptop).</p>
<h3 id="new-features"><a class="header" href="#new-features">New Features</a></h3>
<p>Rust has strong backwards-compatibility guarantees. Thus, new features can't
just be implemented directly in stable Rust. Instead, we have 3 release
channels: stable, beta, and nightly.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stable</strong>: this is the latest stable release for general usage.</li>
<li><strong>Beta</strong>: this is the next release (will be stable within 6 weeks).</li>
<li><strong>Nightly</strong>: follows the <code>master</code> branch of the repo. This is the only
channel where unstable, incomplete, or experimental features are usable with
feature gates.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to implement a new feature, usually you will need to go through <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/README.md">the
RFC process</a> to propose a design, have discussions, etc. In some cases,
small features can be added with only an FCP (<a href="getting-started.html#breaking-changes">see below</a>). If in doubt, ask the
compiler, language, or libs team (whichever is most relevant).</p>
<p>After a feature is approved to be added, a tracking issue is created on the
<code>rust-lang/rust</code> repo, which tracks the progress towards the implementation of
the feature, any bugs reported, and eventually stabilization.</p>
<p>The feature then needs to be implemented behind a feature gate, which prevents
it from being accidentally used.</p>
<p>Finally, somebody may propose stabilizing the feature in an upcoming version of
Rust. This requires a Final Comment Period (<a href="getting-started.html#breaking-changes">see below</a>) to get the
approval of the relevant teams.</p>
<p>After that, the feature gate can be removed and the feature turned on for all users.</p>
<p>For more details on this process, see <a href="./implementing_new_features.html">this chapter on implementing new
features.</a></p>
<h3 id="breaking-changes"><a class="header" href="#breaking-changes">Breaking Changes</a></h3>
<p>As mentioned above, Rust has strong backwards-compatibility guarantees. To this
end, we are reluctant to make breaking changes. However, sometimes they are
needed to correct compiler bugs (e.g. code that compiled but should not) or
make progress on some features.</p>
<p>Depending on the scale of the breakage, there are a few different actions that
can be taken.  If the reviewer believes the breakage is very minimal (i.e. very
unlikely to be actually encountered by users), they may just merge the change.
More often, they will request a Final Comment Period (FCP), which calls for
rough consensus among the members of a relevant team. The team members can
discuss the issue and either accept, reject, or request changes on the PR.</p>
<p>If the scale of breakage is large, a deprecation warning may be needed. This is
a warning that the compiler will display to users whose code will break in the
future. After some time, an FCP can be used to move forward with the actual
breakage.</p>
<p>If the scale of breakage is unknown, a team member or contributor may request a
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/crater">crater</a> run. This is a bot that will compile all crates.io crates and many
public github repos with the compiler with your changes. A report will then be
generated with crates that ceased to compile with or began to compile with your
changes. Crater runs can take a few days to complete.</p>
<h3 id="major-changes"><a class="header" href="#major-changes">Major Changes</a></h3>
<p>The compiler team has a special process for large changes, whether or not they
cause breakage. This process is called a Major Change Proposal (MCP). MCP is a
relatively lightweight mechanism for getting feedback on large changes to the
compiler (as opposed to a full RFC or a design meeting with the team).</p>
<p>Example of things that might require MCPs include major refactorings, changes

<p>Compiler performance is important. We have put a lot of effort over the last
few years into <a href="https://perf.rust-lang.org/dashboard.html">gradually improving it</a>.</p>
<p>If you suspect that your change may cause a performance regression (or
improvement), you can request a &quot;perf run&quot; (your reviewer may also request one
before approving). This is yet another bot that will compile a collection of
benchmarks on a compiler with your changes. The numbers are reported
<a href="https://perf.rust-lang.org">here</a>, and you can see a comparison of your changes against the latest
master.</p>

<p>The compiler is built using a tool called <code>x.py</code>. You will need to
have Python installed to run it.</p>
<p>For instructions on how to install Python and other prerequisites,
see <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust#building-on-a-unix-like-system">the <code>rust-lang/rust</code> README</a>.</p>
<h2 id="get-the-source-code"><a class="header" href="#get-the-source-code">Get the source code</a></h2>
<p>The main repository is <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust"><code>rust-lang/rust</code></a>. This contains the compiler,
the standard library (including <code>core</code>, <code>alloc</code>, <code>test</code>, <code>proc_macro</code>, etc),
and a bunch of tools (e.g. <code>rustdoc</code>, the bootstrapping infrastructure, etc).</p>
<p>The very first step to work on <code>rustc</code> is to clone the repository:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git clone https://github.com/rust-lang/rust.git
cd rust
</code></pre>
<h2 id="what-is-xpy"><a class="header" href="#what-is-xpy">What is <code>x.py</code>?</a></h2>
<p><code>x.py</code> is the build tool for the <code>rust</code> repository. It can build docs, run tests, and compile the
compiler and standard library.</p>
<p>This chapter focuses on the basics to be productive, but
if you want to learn more about <code>x.py</code>, <a href="building/./bootstrapping.html">read this chapter</a>.</p>
<h3 id="running-xpy-slightly-more-conveniently"><a class="header" href="#running-xpy-slightly-more-conveniently">Running <code>x.py</code> slightly more conveniently</a></h3>
<p>There is a binary that wraps <code>x.py</code> called <code>x</code> in <code>src/tools/x</code>. All it does is
run <code>x.py</code>, but it can be installed system-wide and run from any subdirectory
of a checkout. It also looks up the appropriate version of <code>python</code> to use.</p>
<p>You can install it with <code>cargo install --path src/tools/x</code>.</p>
<h2 id="create-a-configtoml"><a class="header" href="#create-a-configtoml">Create a <code>config.toml</code></a></h2>
<p>To start, run <code>./x.py setup</code>. This will do some initialization and create a
<code>config.toml</code> for you with reasonable defaults.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can write <code>config.toml</code> by hand. See <code>config.toml.example</code> for all the available
settings and explanations of them. See <code>src/bootstrap/defaults</code> for common settings to change.</p>
<p>If you have already built <code>rustc</code> and you change settings related to LLVM, then you may have to
execute <code>rm -rf build</code> for subsequent configuration changes to take effect. Note that <code>./x.py clean</code> will not cause a rebuild of LLVM.</p>
<h2 id="building-the-compiler"><a class="header" href="#building-the-compiler">Building the Compiler</a></h2>
<p>Note that building will require a relatively large amount of storage space.
You may want to have upwards of 10 or 15 gigabytes available to build the compiler.</p>
<p>Once you've created a <code>config.toml</code>, you are now ready to run
<code>x.py</code>. There are a lot of options here, but let's start with what is
probably the best &quot;go to&quot; command for building a local compiler:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">./x.py build library
</code></pre>
<p>This may <em>look</em> like it only builds the standard library, but that is not the case.
What this command does is the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build <code>std</code> using the stage0 compiler</li>
<li>Build <code>rustc</code> using the stage0 compiler
<ul>
<li>This produces the stage1 compiler</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Build <code>std</code> using the stage1 compiler</li>
</ul>
<p>This final product (stage1 compiler + libs built using that compiler)
is what you need to build other Rust programs (unless you use <code>#![no_std]</code> or
<code>#![no_core]</code>).</p>
<p>You will probably find that building the stage1 <code>std</code> is a bottleneck for you,
but fear not, there is a (hacky) workaround...
see <a href="building/./suggested.html#faster-builds-with---keep-stage">the section on avoiding rebuilds for std</a>.</p>
<p>Sometimes you don't need a full build. When doing some kind of
&quot;type-based refactoring&quot;, like renaming a method, or changing the
signature of some function, you can use <code>./x.py check</code> instead for a much faster build.</p>
<p>Note that this whole command just gives you a subset of the full <code>rustc</code>
build. The <strong>full</strong> <code>rustc</code> build (what you get with <code>./x.py build --stage 2 compiler/rustc</code>) has quite a few more steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build <code>rustc</code> with the stage1 compiler.
<ul>
<li>The resulting compiler here is called the &quot;stage2&quot; compiler.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Build <code>std</code> with stage2 compiler.</li>
<li>Build <code>librustdoc</code> and a bunch of other things with the stage2 compiler.</li>
</ul>
<p>You almost never need to do this.</p>
<h2 id="build-specific-components"><a class="header" href="#build-specific-components">Build specific components</a></h2>
<p>If you are working on the standard library, you probably don't need to build
the compiler unless you are planning to use a recently added nightly feature.
Instead, you can just build using the bootstrap compiler.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">./x.py build --stage 0 library
</code></pre>
<p>If you choose the <code>library</code> profile when running <code>x.py setup</code>, you can omit <code>--stage 0</code> (it's the
default).</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-rustup-toolchain"><a class="header" href="#creating-a-rustup-toolchain">Creating a rustup toolchain</a></h2>
<p>Once you have successfully built <code>rustc</code>, you will have created a bunch
of files in your <code>build</code> directory. In order to actually run the
resulting <code>rustc</code>, we recommend creating rustup toolchains. The first
one will run the stage1 compiler (which we built above). The second
will execute the stage2 compiler (which we did not build, but which
you will likely need to build at some point; for example, if you want
to run the entire test suite).</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">rustup toolchain link stage1 build/&lt;host-triple&gt;/stage1
rustup toolchain link stage2 build/&lt;host-triple&gt;/stage2
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>&lt;host-triple&gt;</code> would typically be one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux: <code>x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu</code></li>
<li>Mac: <code>x86_64-apple-darwin</code> or <code>aarch64-apple-darwin</code></li>
<li>Windows: <code>x86_64-pc-windows-msvc</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Now you can run the <code>rustc</code> you built with. If you run with <code>-vV</code>, you
should see a version number ending in <code>-dev</code>, indicating a build from
your local environment:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ rustc +stage1 -vV
rustc 1.48.0-dev
binary: rustc
commit-hash: unknown
commit-date: unknown
host: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
release: 1.48.0-dev
LLVM version: 11.0
</code></pre>
<p>The rustup toolchain points to the specified toolchain compiled in your <code>build</code> directory,
so the rustup toolchain will be updated whenever <code>x.py build</code> or <code>x.py test</code> are run for
that toolchain/stage.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> the toolchain we've built does not include <code>cargo</code>.  In this case, <code>rustup</code> will
fall back to using <code>cargo</code> from the installed <code>nightly</code>, <code>beta</code>, or <code>stable</code> toolchain
(in that order).  If you need to use unstable <code>cargo</code> flags, be sure to run
<code>rustup install nightly</code> if you haven't already.  See the
<a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/concepts/toolchains.html#custom-toolchains">rustup documentation on custom toolchains</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> rust-analyzer and IntelliJ Rust plugin use a component called
<code>rust-analyzer-proc-macro-srv</code> to work with proc macros. If you intend to use a
custom toolchain for a project (e.g. via <code>rustup override set stage1</code>) you may
want to build this component:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">./x.py build proc-macro-srv-cli
</code></pre>
<h2 id="building-targets-for-cross-compilation"><a class="header" href="#building-targets-for-cross-compilation">Building targets for cross-compilation</a></h2>
<p>To produce a compiler that can cross-compile for other targets,
pass any number of <code>target</code> flags to <code>x.py build</code>.
For example, if your host platform is <code>x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu</code>
and your cross-compilation target is <code>wasm32-wasi</code>, you can build with:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">./x.py build --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu --target wasm32-wasi
</code></pre>
<p>Note that if you want the resulting compiler to be able to build crates that
involve proc macros or build scripts, you must be sure to explicitly build target support for the
host platform (in this case, <code>x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu</code>).</p>
<p>If you want to always build for other targets without needing to pass flags to <code>x.py build</code>,
you can configure this in the <code>[build]</code> section of your <code>config.toml</code> like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[build]
target = [&quot;x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu&quot;, &quot;wasm32-wasi&quot;]
</code></pre>
<p>Note that building for some targets requires having external dependencies installed
(e.g. building musl targets requires a local copy of musl).
Any target-specific configuration (e.g. the path to a local copy of musl)
will need to be provided by your <code>config.toml</code>.
Please see <code>config.toml.example</code> for information on target-specific configuration keys.</p>
<p>For examples of the complete configuration necessary to build a target, please visit
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/platform-support.html">the rustc book</a>,
select any target under the &quot;Platform Support&quot; heading on the left,
and see the section related to building a compiler for that target.
For targets without a corresponding page in the rustc book,
it may be useful to <a href="building/../tests/docker.html">inspect the Dockerfiles</a>
that the Rust infrastructure itself uses to set up and configure cross-compilation.</p>
<p>If you have followed the directions from the prior section on creating a rustup toolchain,
then once you have built your compiler you will be able to use it to cross-compile like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cargo +stage1 build --target wasm32-wasi
</code></pre>
<h2 id="other-xpy-commands"><a class="header" href="#other-xpy-commands">Other <code>x.py</code> commands</a></h2>
<p>Here are a few other useful <code>x.py</code> commands. We'll cover some of them in detail
in other sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Building things:
<ul>
<li><code>./x.py build</code> – builds everything using the stage 1 compiler,
not just up to <code>std</code></li>
<li><code>./x.py build --stage 2</code> – builds everything with the stage 2 compiler including
<code>rustdoc</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Running tests (see the <a href="building/../tests/running.html">section on running tests</a> for
more details):
<ul>
<li><code>./x.py test library/std</code> – runs the unit tests and integration tests from <code>std</code></li>
<li><code>./x.py test tests/ui</code> – runs the <code>ui</code> test suite</li>
<li><code>./x.py test tests/ui/const-generics</code> - runs all the tests in
the <code>const-generics/</code> subdirectory of the <code>ui</code> test suite</li>
<li><code>./x.py test tests/ui/const-generics/const-types.rs</code> - runs
the single test <code>const-types.rs</code> from the <code>ui</code> test suite</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="cleaning-out-build-directories"><a class="header" href="#cleaning-out-build-directories">Cleaning out build directories</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes you need to start fresh, but this is normally not the case.
If you need to run this then <code>rustbuild</code> is most likely not acting right and
you should file a bug as to what is going wrong. If you do need to clean
everything up then you only need to run one command!</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">./x.py clean
</code></pre>
<p><code>rm -rf build</code> works too, but then you have to rebuild LLVM, which can take
a long time even on fast computers.</p>

<h2 id="hardware"><a class="header" href="#hardware">Hardware</a></h2>
<p>You will need an internet connection to build. The bootstrapping process
involves updating git submodules and downloading a beta compiler. It doesn't
need to be super fast, but that can help.</p>
<p>There are no strict hardware requirements, but building the compiler is
computationally expensive, so a beefier machine will help, and I wouldn't
recommend trying to build on a Raspberry Pi! We recommend the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>30GB+ of free disk space. Otherwise, you will have to keep
clearing incremental caches. More space is better, the compiler is a bit of a
hog; it's a problem we are aware of.</li>
<li>8GB+ RAM</li>
<li>2+ cores. Having more cores really helps. 10 or 20 or more is not too many!</li>
</ul>
<p>Beefier machines will lead to much faster builds. If your machine is not very
powerful, a common strategy is to only use <code>./x.py check</code> on your local machine
and let the CI build test your changes when you push to a PR branch.</p>
<p>Building the compiler takes more than half an hour on my moderately powerful
laptop. We suggest downloading LLVM from CI so you don't have to build it from source
(<a href="building/./how-to-build-and-run.html#create-a-configtoml">see here</a>).</p>
<p>Like <code>cargo</code>, the build system will use as many cores as possible. Sometimes
this can cause you to run low on memory. You can use <code>-j</code> to adjust the number
concurrent jobs. If a full build takes more than ~45 minutes to an hour, you
are probably spending most of the time swapping memory in and out; try using
<code>-j1</code>.</p>
<p>If you don't have too much free disk space, you may want to turn off
incremental compilation (<a href="building/./how-to-build-and-run.html#create-a-configtoml">see here</a>). This will make compilation take
longer (especially after a rebase), but will save a ton of space from the
incremental caches.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="suggested-workflows"><a class="header" href="#suggested-workflows">Suggested Workflows</a></h1>
<p>The full bootstrapping process takes quite a while. Here are some suggestions
to make your life easier.</p>
<h2 id="installing-a-pre-push-hook"><a class="header" href="#installing-a-pre-push-hook">Installing a pre-push hook</a></h2>
<p>CI will automatically fail your build if it doesn't pass <code>tidy</code>, our
internal tool for ensuring code quality. If you'd like, you can install a
<a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks">Git hook</a>
that will automatically run <code>./x.py test tidy</code> on each push, to ensure
your code is up to par. If the hook fails then run <code>./x.py test tidy --bless</code>
and commit the changes. If you decide later that the pre-push behavior is
undesirable, you can delete the <code>pre-push</code> file in <code>.git/hooks</code>.</p>
<p>A prebuilt git hook lives at <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/etc/pre-push.sh"><code>src/etc/pre-push.sh</code></a> which can be copied into your <code>.git/hooks</code> folder as <code>pre-push</code> (without the <code>.sh</code> extension!).</p>
<p>You can also install the hook as a step of running <code>./x.py setup</code>!</p>
<h2 id="configuring-rust-analyzer-for-rustc"><a class="header" href="#configuring-rust-analyzer-for-rustc">Configuring <code>rust-analyzer</code> for <code>rustc</code></a></h2>
<p><code>rust-analyzer</code> can help you check and format your code whenever you save
a file. By default, <code>rust-analyzer</code> runs the <code>cargo check</code> and <code>rustfmt</code>
commands, but you can override these commands to use more adapted versions
of these tools when hacking on <code>rustc</code>. For example, for Visual Studio Code,
you can write: <!-- date-check: nov 2022 --><!-- the date comment is for the edition below --></p>
<pre><code class="language-JSON">{
    &quot;rust-analyzer.checkOnSave.overrideCommand&quot;: [
        &quot;python3&quot;,
        &quot;x.py&quot;,
        &quot;check&quot;,
        &quot;--json-output&quot;
    ],
    &quot;rust-analyzer.rustfmt.overrideCommand&quot;: [
        &quot;./build/host/stage0/bin/rustfmt&quot;,

    &quot;rust-analyzer.rustc.source&quot;: &quot;./Cargo.toml&quot;,
}
</code></pre>
<p>in your <code>.vscode/settings.json</code> file. This will ask <code>rust-analyzer</code> to use
<code>./x.py check</code> to check the sources, and the stage 0 rustfmt to format them.</p>
<p>If you have enough free disk space and you would like to be able to run <code>x.py</code> commands while
rust-analyzer runs in the background, you can also add <code>--build-dir build-rust-analyzer</code> to the
<code>overrideCommand</code> to avoid x.py locking.</p>
<p>If you're running <code>coc.nvim</code>, you can use <code>:CocLocalConfig</code> to create a
<code>.vim/coc-settings.json</code> and enter the same settings as above, but replacing
<code>editor.formatOnSave: true,</code> with
<code>&quot;coc.preferences.formatOnSaveFiletypes&quot;: [&quot;rust&quot;],</code>.</p>
<p>If running <code>./x.py check</code> on save is inconvenient, in VS Code you can use a <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks">Build

<h2 id="check-check-and-check-again"><a class="header" href="#check-check-and-check-again">Check, check, and check again</a></h2>
<p>When doing simple refactorings, it can be useful to run <code>./x.py check</code>
continuously. If you set up <code>rust-analyzer</code> as described above, this will
be done for you every time you save a file. Here you are just checking that
the compiler can <strong>build</strong>, but often that is all you need (e.g., when renaming a
method). You can then run <code>./x.py build</code> when you actually need to
run tests.</p>
<p>In fact, it is sometimes useful to put off tests even when you are not
100% sure the code will work. You can then keep building up
refactoring commits and only run the tests at some later time. You can
then use <code>git bisect</code> to track down <strong>precisely</strong> which commit caused
the problem. A nice side-effect of this style is that you are left
with a fairly fine-grained set of commits at the end, all of which
build and pass tests. This often helps reviewing.</p>
<h2 id="configuring-rustup-to-use-nightly"><a class="header" href="#configuring-rustup-to-use-nightly">Configuring <code>rustup</code> to use nightly</a></h2>
<p>Some parts of the bootstrap process uses pinned, nightly versions of tools like
rustfmt. To make things like <code>cargo fmt</code> work correctly in your repo, run</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">cd &lt;path to rustc repo&gt;
rustup override set nightly
</code></pre>
<p>after <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/concepts/channels.html?highlight=nightl#working-with-nightly-rust">installing a nightly toolchain</a> with <code>rustup</code>. Don't forget to do this for all
directories you have <a href="building/./suggested.html#working-on-multiple-branches-at-the-same-time">setup a worktree for</a>. You may need to use the pinned
nightly version from <code>src/stage0.json</code>, but often the normal <code>nightly</code> channel
will work.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> see <a href="building/suggested.html#configuring-rust-analyzer-for-rustc">the section on vscode</a> for how to configure it with this real rustfmt <code>x.py</code> uses,
and <a href="building/how-to-build-and-run.html">the section on rustup</a> for how to setup <code>rustup</code> toolchain for your bootstrapped compiler</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> This does <em>not</em> allow you to build <code>rustc</code> with cargo directly. You
still have to use <code>x.py</code> to work on the compiler or standard library, this just
lets you use <code>cargo fmt</code>.</p>
<h2 id="faster-builds-with---keep-stage"><a class="header" href="#faster-builds-with---keep-stage">Faster builds with <code>--keep-stage</code>.</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes just checking
whether the compiler builds is not enough. A common example is that
you need to add a <code>debug!</code> statement to inspect the value of some
state or better understand the problem. In that case, you really need
a full build. By bypassing bootstrap's cache invalidation, you can often get
these builds to complete very fast (e.g., around 30 seconds). The only
catch is this requires a bit of fudging and may produce compilers that
don't work (but that is easily detected and fixed).</p>
<p>The sequence of commands you want is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initial build: <code>./x.py build library</code>
<ul>
<li>As <a href="building/./how-to-build-and-run.html#building-the-compiler">documented previously</a>, this will build a functional
stage1 compiler as part of running all stage0 commands (which include
building a <code>std</code> compatible with the stage1 compiler) as well as the
first few steps of the &quot;stage 1 actions&quot; up to &quot;stage1 (sysroot stage1)
builds std&quot;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Subsequent builds: <code>./x.py build library --keep-stage 1</code>
<ul>
<li>Note that we added the <code>--keep-stage 1</code> flag here</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As mentioned, the effect of <code>--keep-stage 1</code> is that we just <em>assume</em> that the
old standard library can be re-used. If you are editing the compiler, this
is almost always true: you haven't changed the standard library, after
all. But sometimes, it's not true: for example, if you are editing
the &quot;metadata&quot; part of the compiler, which controls how the compiler
encodes types and other states into the <code>rlib</code> files, or if you are
editing things that wind up in the metadata (such as the definition of
the MIR).</p>
<p><strong>The TL;DR is that you might get weird behavior from a compile when
using <code>--keep-stage 1</code></strong> -- for example, strange
<a href="building/../appendix/glossary.html#ice">ICEs</a> or other panics. In that case, you
should simply remove the <code>--keep-stage 1</code> from the command and
rebuild. That ought to fix the problem.</p>
<p>You can also use <code>--keep-stage 1</code> when running tests. Something like this:</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h2 id="using-incremental-compilation"><a class="header" href="#using-incremental-compilation">Using incremental compilation</a></h2>
<p>You can further enable the <code>--incremental</code> flag to save additional
time in subsequent rebuilds:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">./x.py test tests/ui --incremental --test-args issue-1234
</code></pre>
<p>If you don't want to include the flag with every command, you can
enable it in the <code>config.toml</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[rust]
incremental = true
</code></pre>
<p>Note that incremental compilation will use more disk space than usual.
If disk space is a concern for you, you might want to check the size
of the <code>build</code> directory from time to time.</p>
<h2 id="fine-tuning-optimizations"><a class="header" href="#fine-tuning-optimizations">Fine-tuning optimizations</a></h2>
<p>Setting <code>optimize = false</code> makes the compiler too slow for tests. However, to
improve the test cycle, you can disable optimizations selectively only for the
crates you'll have to rebuild
(<a href="https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler/topic/incremental.20compilation.20question/near/202712165">source</a>).
For example, when working on <code>rustc_mir_build</code>, the <code>rustc_mir_build</code> and
<code>rustc_driver</code> crates take the most time to incrementally rebuild. You could
therefore set the following in the root <code>Cargo.toml</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[profile.release.package.rustc_mir_build]
opt-level = 0
[profile.release.package.rustc_driver]
opt-level = 0
</code></pre>
<h2 id="working-on-multiple-branches-at-the-same-time"><a class="header" href="#working-on-multiple-branches-at-the-same-time">Working on multiple branches at the same time</a></h2>
<p>Working on multiple branches in parallel can be a little annoying, since
building the compiler on one branch will cause the old build and the
incremental compilation cache to be overwritten. One solution would be
to have multiple clones of the repository, but that would mean storing the
Git metadata multiple times, and having to update each clone individually.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Git has a better solution called <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-worktree">worktrees</a>. This lets you
create multiple &quot;working trees&quot;, which all share the same Git database.
Moreover, because all of the worktrees share the same object database,
if you update a branch (e.g. master) in any of them, you can use the new
commits from any of the worktrees. One caveat, though, is that submodules
do not get shared. They will still be cloned multiple times.</p>
<p>Given you are inside the root directory for your Rust repository, you can
create a &quot;linked working tree&quot; in a new &quot;rust2&quot; directory by running
the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git worktree add ../rust2
</code></pre>
<p>Creating a new worktree for a new branch based on <code>master</code> looks like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git worktree add -b my-feature ../rust2 master
</code></pre>
<p>You can then use that rust2 folder as a separate workspace for modifying
and building <code>rustc</code>!</p>

<p>You might want to build and package up the compiler for distribution.
You’ll want to run this command to do it:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">./x.py dist
</code></pre>
<h1 id="install-distribution-artifacts"><a class="header" href="#install-distribution-artifacts">Install distribution artifacts</a></h1>
<p>If you’ve built a distribution artifact you might want to install it and
test that it works on your target system. You’ll want to run this command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">./x.py install
</code></pre>
<p>Note: If you are testing out a modification to a compiler, you
might want to use it to compile some project.
Usually, you do not want to use <code>./x.py install</code> for testing.
Rather, you should create a toolchain as discussed in
<a href="building/./how-to-build-and-run.html#creating-a-rustup-toolchain">here</a>.</p>
<p>For example, if the toolchain you created is called foo, you
would then invoke it with <code>rustc +foo ...</code> (where ... represents
the rest of the arguments).</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="building-documentation"><a class="header" href="#building-documentation">Building documentation</a></h1>
<p>This chapter describes how to build documentation of toolchain components,
like the standard library (std) or the compiler (rustc).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Document everything</p>
<p>This uses <code>rustdoc</code> from the beta toolchain,
so will produce (slightly) different output to stage 1 rustdoc,
as rustdoc is under active development:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">./x.py doc
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to be sure the documentation looks the same as on CI:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">./x.py doc --stage 1
</code></pre>
<p>This ensures that (current) rustdoc gets built,
then that is used to document the components.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Much like running individual tests or building specific components,
you can build just the documentation you want:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">./x.py doc src/doc/book
./x.py doc src/doc/nomicon
./x.py doc compiler library
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Document internal rustc items</p>
<p>Compiler documentation is not built by default.
To create it by default with <code>x.py doc</code>, modify <code>config.toml</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[build]
compiler-docs = true
</code></pre>
<p>Note that when enabled,
documentation for internal compiler items will also be built.</p>
<p>NOTE: The documentation for the compiler is found at <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/">this link</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="rustdoc-overview"><a class="header" href="#rustdoc-overview">Rustdoc overview</a></h1>
<p><code>rustdoc</code> uses <code>rustc</code> internals (and, of course, the standard library), so you
will have to build the compiler and <code>std</code> once before you can build <code>rustdoc</code>.</p>
<p><code>rustdoc</code> lives in-tree with the
compiler and standard library. This chapter is about how it works.
For information about Rustdoc's features and how to use them, see
the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustdoc/">Rustdoc book</a>.
For more details about how rustdoc works, see the
<a href="./rustdoc-internals.html">&quot;Rustdoc internals&quot; chapter</a>.</p>
<p>Rustdoc is implemented entirely within the crate <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/librustdoc"><code>librustdoc</code></a>. It runs
the compiler up to the point where we have an internal representation of a
crate (HIR) and the ability to run some queries about the types of items. <a href="./hir.html">HIR</a>
and <a href="./query.html">queries</a> are discussed in the linked chapters.</p>
<p><code>librustdoc</code> performs two major steps after that to render a set of
documentation:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Clean&quot; the AST into a form that's more suited to creating documentation (and
slightly more resistant to churn in the compiler).</li>
<li>Use this cleaned AST to render a crate's documentation, one page at a time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Naturally, there's more than just this, and those descriptions simplify out
lots of details, but that's the high-level overview.</p>
<p>(Side note: <code>librustdoc</code> is a library crate! The <code>rustdoc</code> binary is created
using the project in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/tools/rustdoc"><code>src/tools/rustdoc</code></a>. Note that literally all that
does is call the <code>main()</code> that's in this crate's <code>lib.rs</code>, though.)</p>
<h2 id="cheat-sheet"><a class="header" href="#cheat-sheet">Cheat sheet</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Run <code>./x.py setup tools</code> before getting started. This will configure <code>x.py</code>
with nice settings for developing rustdoc and other tools, including
downloading a copy of rustc rather than building it.</li>
<li>Use <code>./x.py check src/tools/rustdoc</code> to quickly check for compile errors.</li>
<li>Use <code>./x.py build</code> to make a usable
rustdoc you can run on other projects.
<ul>
<li>Add <code>library/test</code> to be able to use <code>rustdoc --test</code>.</li>
<li>Run <code>rustup toolchain link stage2 build/host/stage2</code> to add a
custom toolchain called <code>stage2</code> to your rustup environment. After
running that, <code>cargo +stage2 doc</code> in any directory will build with
your locally-compiled rustdoc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use <code>./x.py doc library</code> to use this rustdoc to generate the
standard library docs.
<ul>
<li>The completed docs will be available in <code>build/host/doc</code> (under <code>core</code>, <code>alloc</code>, and <code>std</code>).</li>
<li>If you want to copy those docs to a webserver, copy all of
<code>build/host/doc</code>, since that's where the CSS, JS, fonts, and landing
page are.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Use <code>./x.py test tests/rustdoc*</code> to run the tests using a stage1
rustdoc.
<ul>
<li>See <a href="./rustdoc-internals.html">Rustdoc internals</a> for more information about tests.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="code-structure"><a class="header" href="#code-structure">Code structure</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>All paths in this section are relative to <code>src/librustdoc</code> in the rust-lang/rust repository.</li>
<li>Most of the HTML printing code is in <code>html/format.rs</code> and <code>html/render/mod.rs</code>.
It's in a bunch of <code>fmt::Display</code> implementations and supplementary
functions.</li>
<li>The types that got <code>Display</code> impls above are defined in <code>clean/mod.rs</code>, right
next to the custom <code>Clean</code> trait used to process them out of the rustc HIR.</li>
<li>The bits specific to using rustdoc as a test harness are in
<code>doctest.rs</code>.</li>
<li>The Markdown renderer is loaded up in <code>html/markdown.rs</code>, including functions
for extracting doctests from a given block of Markdown.</li>
<li>The tests on the structure of rustdoc HTML output are located in <code>tests/rustdoc</code>, where
they're handled by the test runner of rustbuild and the supplementary script
<code>src/etc/htmldocck.py</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tests"><a class="header" href="#tests">Tests</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>All paths in this section are relative to <code>tests</code> in the rust-lang/rust repository.</li>
<li>Tests on search index generation are located in <code>rustdoc-js</code>, as a
series of JavaScript files that encode queries on the standard library search
index and expected results.</li>
<li>Tests on the &quot;UI&quot; of rustdoc (the terminal output it produces when run) are in
<code>rustdoc-ui</code></li>
<li>Tests on the &quot;GUI&quot; of rustdoc (the HTML, JS, and CSS as rendered in a browser)
are in <code>rustdoc-gui</code>. These use a <a href="https://github.com/GuillaumeGomez/browser-UI-test/">NodeJS tool called
browser-UI-test</a> that uses
puppeteer to run tests in a headless browser and check rendering and
interactivity.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="constraints"><a class="header" href="#constraints">Constraints</a></h2>
<p>We try to make rustdoc work reasonably well with JavaScript disabled, and when
browsing local files. We support
<a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/1985-tiered-browser-support.html#supported-browsers">these browsers</a>.</p>
<p>Supporting local files (<code>file:///</code> URLs) brings some surprising restrictions.
Certain browser features that require secure origins, like <code>localStorage</code> and
Service Workers, don't work reliably. We can still use such features but we
should make sure pages are still usable without them.</p>
<h2 id="multiple-runs-same-output-directory"><a class="header" href="#multiple-runs-same-output-directory">Multiple runs, same output directory</a></h2>
<p>Rustdoc can be run multiple times for varying inputs, with its output set to the
same directory. That's how cargo produces documentation for dependencies of the
current crate. It can also be done manually if a user wants a big
documentation bundle with all of the docs they care about.</p>
<p>HTML is generated independently for each crate, but there is some cross-crate
information that we update as we add crates to the output directory:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>crates&lt;SUFFIX&gt;.js</code> holds a list of all crates in the output directory.</li>
<li><code>search-index&lt;SUFFIX&gt;.js</code> holds a list of all searchable items.</li>
<li>For each trait, there is a file under <code>implementors/.../trait.TraitName.js</code>
containing a list of implementors of that trait. The implementors may be in
different crates than the trait, and the JS file is updated as we discover
new ones.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="use-cases"><a class="header" href="#use-cases">Use cases</a></h2>
<p>There are a few major use cases for rustdoc that you should keep in mind when
working on it:</p>
<h3 id="standard-library-docs"><a class="header" href="#standard-library-docs">Standard library docs</a></h3>
<p>These are published at <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std">https://doc.rust-lang.org/std</a> as part of the Rust release
process. Stable releases are also uploaded to specific versioned URLs like
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.57.0/std/">https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.57.0/std/</a>. Beta and nightly docs are published to
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/std/">https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/std/</a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/">https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/std/</a>.
The docs are uploaded with the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/promote-release">promote-release
tool</a> and served from S3 with
CloudFront.</p>
<p>The standard library docs contain five crates: alloc, core, proc_macro, std, and
test.</p>
<h3 id="docsrs"><a class="header" href="#docsrs">docs.rs</a></h3>
<p>When crates are published to crates.io, docs.rs automatically builds
and publishes their documentation, for instance at
<a href="https://docs.rs/serde/latest/serde/">https://docs.rs/serde/latest/serde/</a>. It always builds with the current nightly
rustdoc, so any changes you land in rustdoc are &quot;insta-stable&quot; in that they will
have an immediate public effect on docs.rs. Old documentation is not rebuilt, so
you will see some variation in UI when browsing old releases in docs.rs. Crate
authors can request rebuilds, which will be run with the latest rustdoc.</p>
<p>Docs.rs performs some transformations on rustdoc's output in order to save
storage and display a navigation bar at the top. In particular, certain static
files, like main.js and rustdoc.css, may be shared across multiple invocations
of the same version of rustdoc. Others, like crates.js and sidebar-items.js, are
different for different invocations. Still others, like fonts, will never
change. These categories are distinguished using the <code>SharedResource</code> enum in
<code>src/librustdoc/html/render/write_shared.rs</code></p>
<p>Documentation on docs.rs is always generated for a single crate at a time, so
the search and sidebar functionality don't include dependencies of the current
crate.</p>
<h3 id="locally-generated-docs"><a class="header" href="#locally-generated-docs">Locally generated docs</a></h3>
<p>Crate authors can run <code>cargo doc --open</code> in crates they have checked
out locally to see the docs. This is useful to check that the docs they
are writing are useful and display correctly. It can also be useful for
people to view documentation on crates they aren't authors of, but want to
use. In both cases, people may use <code>--document-private-items</code> Cargo flag to
see private methods, fields, and so on, which are normally not displayed.</p>
<p>By default <code>cargo doc</code> will generate documentation for a crate and all of its
dependencies. That can result in a very large documentation bundle, with a large
(and slow) search corpus. The Cargo flag <code>--no-deps</code> inhibits that behavior and
generates docs for just the crate.</p>
<h3 id="self-hosted-project-docs"><a class="header" href="#self-hosted-project-docs">Self-hosted project docs</a></h3>
<p>Some projects like to host their own documentation. For example:
<a href="https://docs.serde.rs/">https://docs.serde.rs/</a>. This is easy to do by locally generating docs, and
simply copying them to a web server. Rustdoc's HTML output can be extensively
customized by flags. Users can add a theme, set the default theme, and inject
arbitrary HTML. See <code>rustdoc --help</code> for details.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="adding-a-new-target"><a class="header" href="#adding-a-new-target">Adding a new target</a></h1>
<p>These are a set of steps to add support for a new target. There are
numerous end states and paths to get there, so not all sections may be
relevant to your desired goal.</p>
<h2 id="specifying-a-new-llvm"><a class="header" href="#specifying-a-new-llvm">Specifying a new LLVM</a></h2>
<p>For very new targets, you may need to use a different fork of LLVM
than what is currently shipped with Rust. In that case, navigate to
the <code>src/llvm-project</code> git submodule (you might need to run <code>./x.py check</code> at least once so the submodule is updated), check out the
appropriate commit for your fork, then commit that new submodule
reference in the main Rust repository.</p>
<p>An example would be:</p>
<pre><code>cd src/llvm-project
git remote add my-target-llvm some-llvm-repository
git checkout my-target-llvm/my-branch
cd ..
git add llvm-project
git commit -m 'Use my custom LLVM'
</code></pre>
<h3 id="using-pre-built-llvm"><a class="header" href="#using-pre-built-llvm">Using pre-built LLVM</a></h3>
<p>If you have a local LLVM checkout that is already built, you may be
able to configure Rust to treat your build as the system LLVM to avoid
redundant builds.</p>
<p>You can tell Rust to use a pre-built version of LLVM using the <code>target</code> section
of <code>config.toml</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu]
llvm-config = &quot;/path/to/llvm/llvm-7.0.1/bin/llvm-config&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>If you are attempting to use a system LLVM, we have observed the following paths
before, though they may be different from your system:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>/usr/bin/llvm-config-8</code></li>
<li><code>/usr/lib/llvm-8/bin/llvm-config</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Note that you need to have the LLVM <code>FileCheck</code> tool installed, which is used
for codegen tests. This tool is normally built with LLVM, but if you use your
own preinstalled LLVM, you will need to provide <code>FileCheck</code> in some other way.
On Debian-based systems, you can install the <code>llvm-N-tools</code> package (where <code>N</code>
is the LLVM version number, e.g. <code>llvm-8-tools</code>). Alternately, you can specify
the path to <code>FileCheck</code> with the <code>llvm-filecheck</code> config item in <code>config.toml</code>
or you can disable codegen test with the <code>codegen-tests</code> item in <code>config.toml</code>.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-target-specification"><a class="header" href="#creating-a-target-specification">Creating a target specification</a></h2>
<p>You should start with a target JSON file. You can see the specification
for an existing target using <code>--print target-spec-json</code>:</p>
<pre><code>rustc -Z unstable-options --target=wasm32-unknown-unknown --print target-spec-json
</code></pre>
<p>Save that JSON to a file and modify it as appropriate for your target.</p>
<h3 id="adding-a-target-specification"><a class="header" href="#adding-a-target-specification">Adding a target specification</a></h3>
<p>Once you have filled out a JSON specification and been able to compile
somewhat successfully, you can copy the specification into the
compiler itself.</p>
<p>You will need to add a line to the big table inside of the
<code>supported_targets</code> macro in the <code>rustc_target::spec</code> module. You
will then add a corresponding file for your new target containing a
<code>target</code> function.</p>
<p>Look for existing targets to use as examples.</p>
<p>After adding your target to the <code>rustc_target</code> crate you may want to add
<code>core</code>, <code>std</code>, ... with support for your new target. In that case you will
probably need access to some <code>target_*</code> cfg. Unfortunately when building with
stage0 (the beta compiler), you'll get an error that the target cfg is
unexpected because stage0 doesn't know about the new target specification and
we pass <code>--check-cfg</code> in order to tell it to check.</p>
<p>To fix the errors you will need to manually add the unexpected value to the
<code>EXTRA_CHECK_CFGS</code> list in <code>src/bootstrap/lib.rs</code>. Here is an example for
adding <code>NEW_TARGET_OS</code> as <code>target_os</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-diff">- (Some(Mode::Std), &quot;target_os&quot;, Some(&amp;[&quot;watchos&quot;])),
+ // #[cfg(bootstrap)] NEW_TARGET_OS
+ (Some(Mode::Std), &quot;target_os&quot;, Some(&amp;[&quot;watchos&quot;, &quot;NEW_TARGET_OS&quot;])),
</code></pre>
<h2 id="patching-crates"><a class="header" href="#patching-crates">Patching crates</a></h2>
<p>You may need to make changes to crates that the compiler depends on,
such as <a href="https://crates.io/crates/libc"><code>libc</code></a> or <a href="https://crates.io/crates/cc"><code>cc</code></a>. If so, you can use Cargo's
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/cargo/reference/overriding-dependencies.html#the-patch-section"><code>[patch]</code></a> ability. For example, if you want to use an
unreleased version of <code>libc</code>, you can add it to the top-level
<code>Cargo.toml</code> file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-diff">diff --git a/Cargo.toml b/Cargo.toml
index 1e83f05e0ca..4d0172071c1 100644

<p>After this, run <code>cargo update -p libc</code> to update the lockfiles.</p>
<p>Beware that if you patch to a local <code>path</code> dependency, this will enable
warnings for that dependency. Some dependencies are not warning-free, and due
to the <code>deny-warnings</code> setting in <code>config.toml</code>, the build may suddenly start
to fail. To work around the warnings, you may want to disable <code>deny-warnings</code>
in the config, or modify the dependency to remove the warnings.</p>
<h2 id="cross-compiling"><a class="header" href="#cross-compiling">Cross-compiling</a></h2>
<p>Once you have a target specification in JSON and in the code, you can
cross-compile <code>rustc</code>:</p>
<pre><code>DESTDIR=/path/to/install/in \
./x.py install -i --stage 1 --host aarch64-apple-darwin.json --target aarch64-apple-darwin \

compiler, you can use it instead of the JSON file for both arguments.</p>

<p>There are two levels of tier 2 targets:

b) Targets that <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/target-tier-policy.html#tier-2-with-host-tools">have a native toolchain</a> (<code>rustup toolchain install</code>)</p>

<p>The Rust project runs a wide variety of different tests, orchestrated by
the build system (<code>./x.py test</code>).
This section gives a brief overview of the different testing tools.
Subsequent chapters dive into <a href="tests/running.html">running tests</a> and <a href="tests/adding.html">adding new tests</a>.</p>
<h2 id="kinds-of-tests"><a class="header" href="#kinds-of-tests">Kinds of tests</a></h2>
<p>There are several kinds of tests to exercise things in the Rust distribution.
Almost all of them are driven by <code>./x.py test</code>, with some exceptions noted below.</p>
<h3 id="compiletest"><a class="header" href="#compiletest">Compiletest</a></h3>
<p>The main test harness for testing the compiler itself is a tool called <a href="tests/compiletest.html">compiletest</a>.
It supports running different styles of tests, called <em>test suites</em>.
The tests are all located in the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/tests"><code>tests</code></a> directory.
The <a href="tests/compiletest.html">Compiletest chapter</a> goes into detail on how to use this tool.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example: <code>./x.py test tests/ui</code></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="package-tests"><a class="header" href="#package-tests">Package tests</a></h3>
<p>The standard library and many of the compiler packages include typical Rust <code>#[test]</code>
unit tests, integration tests, and documentation tests.
You can pass a path to <code>x.py</code> to almost any package in the <code>library</code> or <code>compiler</code> directory,
and <code>x.py</code> will essentially run <code>cargo test</code> on that package.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Command</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><code>./x.py test library/std</code></td><td>Runs tests on <code>std</code> only</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>./x.py test library/core</code></td><td>Runs tests on <code>core</code> only</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>./x.py test compiler/rustc_data_structures</code></td><td>Runs tests on <code>rustc_data_structures</code></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>The standard library relies very heavily on documentation tests to cover its functionality.
However, unit tests and integration tests can also be used as needed.
Almost all of the compiler packages have doctests disabled.</p>
<p>The standard library and compiler always place all unit tests in a separate <code>tests</code> file
(this is enforced in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/tools/tidy/src/unit_tests.rs">tidy</a>).
This approach ensures that when the test file is changed, the crate does not need to be recompiled.
For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">#[cfg(test)]
mod tests;
</code></pre>
<p>If it wasn't done this way, and the tests were placed in the same file as the source,
then changing or adding a test would cause the crate you are working on to be recompiled.
If you were working on something like <code>core</code>,
then that would require recompiling the entire standard library, and the entirety of <code>rustc</code>.</p>
<p><code>./x.py test</code> includes some CLI options for controlling the behavior with these tests:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>--doc</code> — Only runs documentation tests in the package.</li>
<li><code>--no-doc</code> — Run all tests <em>except</em> documentation tests.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tidy"><a class="header" href="#tidy">Tidy</a></h3>
<p>Tidy is a custom tool used for validating source code style and formatting conventions,
such as rejecting long lines.
There is more information in the <a href="tests/../conventions.html#formatting">section on coding conventions</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example: <code>./x.py test tidy</code></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="formatting"><a class="header" href="#formatting">Formatting</a></h3>
<p>Rustfmt is integrated with the build system to enforce uniform style across the compiler.
The formatting check is automatically run by the Tidy tool mentioned above.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Command</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><code>./x.py fmt --check</code></td><td>Checks formatting and exits with an error if formatting is needed.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>./x.py fmt</code></td><td>Runs rustfmt across the entire codebase.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>./x.py test tidy --bless</code></td><td>First runs rustfmt to format the codebase, then runs tidy checks.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<h3 id="book-documentation-tests"><a class="header" href="#book-documentation-tests">Book documentation tests</a></h3>
<p>All of the books that are published have their own tests,
primarily for validating that the Rust code examples pass.
Under the hood, these are essentially using <code>rustdoc --test</code> on the markdown files.
The tests can be run by passing a path to a book to <code>./x.py test</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example: <code>./x.py test src/doc/book</code></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="documentation-link-checker"><a class="header" href="#documentation-link-checker">Documentation link checker</a></h3>
<p>Links across all documentation is validated with a link checker tool.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example: <code>./x.py test src/tools/linkchecker</code></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Example: <code>./x.py test linkchecker</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This requires building all of the documentation, which might take a while.</p>
<h3 id="dist-check"><a class="header" href="#dist-check">Dist check</a></h3>
<p><code>distcheck</code> verifies that the source distribution tarball created by the build system
will unpack, build, and run all tests.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example: <code>./x.py test distcheck</code></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="tool-tests"><a class="header" href="#tool-tests">Tool tests</a></h3>
<p>Packages that are included with Rust have all of their tests run as well.
This includes things such as cargo, clippy, rustfmt, miri, bootstrap
(testing the Rust build system itself), etc.</p>
<p>Most of the tools are located in the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/tools/"><code>src/tools</code></a> directory.
To run the tool's tests, just pass its path to <code>./x.py test</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example: <code>./x.py test src/tools/cargo</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Usually these tools involve running <code>cargo test</code> within the tool's directory.</p>
<p>In CI, some tools are allowed to fail.
Failures send notifications to the corresponding teams, and is tracked on the <a href="https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-toolstate/">toolstate website</a>.
More information can be found in the <a href="https://forge.rust-lang.org/infra/toolstate.html">toolstate documentation</a>.</p>
<h3 id="cargo-test"><a class="header" href="#cargo-test">Cargo test</a></h3>
<p><code>cargotest</code> is a small tool which runs <code>cargo test</code> on a few sample projects
(such as <code>servo</code>, <code>ripgrep</code>, <code>tokei</code>, etc.).
This ensures there aren't any significant regressions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Example: <code>./x.py test src/tools/cargotest</code></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="crater"><a class="header" href="#crater">Crater</a></h3>
<p>Crater is a tool which runs tests on many thousands of public projects.
This tool has its own separate infrastructure for running.
See the <a href="tests/crater.html">Crater chapter</a> for more details.</p>
<h3 id="performance-testing"><a class="header" href="#performance-testing">Performance testing</a></h3>
<p>A separate infrastructure is used for testing and tracking performance of the compiler.
See the <a href="tests/perf.html">Performance testing chapter</a> for more details.</p>

<p>You can run the tests using <code>x.py</code>. The most basic command – which
you will almost never want to use! – is as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">./x.py test
</code></pre>
<p>This will build the stage 1 compiler and then run the whole test
suite. You probably don't want to do this very often, because it takes
a very long time, and anyway bors / GitHub Actions will do it for you.
(Often, I will run this command in the background after opening a PR that
I think is done, but rarely otherwise. -nmatsakis)</p>
<p>The test results are cached and previously successful tests are
<code>ignored</code> during testing. The stdout/stderr contents as well as a
timestamp file for every test can be found under <code>build/ARCH/test/</code>.
To force-rerun a test (e.g. in case the test runner fails to notice a change)
you can simply remove the timestamp file, or use the <code>--force-rerun</code> CLI
option.</p>
<p>Note that some tests require a Python-enabled gdb. You can test if
your gdb install supports Python by using the <code>python</code> command from
within gdb. Once invoked you can type some Python code (e.g.
<code>print(&quot;hi&quot;)</code>) followed by return and then <code>CTRL+D</code> to execute it.
If you are building gdb from source, you will need to configure with
<code>--with-python=&lt;path-to-python-binary&gt;</code>.</p>
<h2 id="running-a-subset-of-the-test-suites"><a class="header" href="#running-a-subset-of-the-test-suites">Running a subset of the test suites</a></h2>
<p>When working on a specific PR, you will usually want to run a smaller
set of tests. For example, a good &quot;smoke test&quot; that can be used after
modifying rustc to see if things are generally working correctly would be the
following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">./x.py test tests/ui
</code></pre>
<p>This will run the <code>ui</code> test suite. Of course, the choice
of test suites is somewhat arbitrary, and may not suit the task you are
doing. For example, if you are hacking on debuginfo, you may be better off
with the debuginfo test suite:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">./x.py test tests/debuginfo
</code></pre>
<p>If you only need to test a specific subdirectory of tests for any
given test suite, you can pass that directory to <code>./x.py test</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">./x.py test tests/ui/const-generics
</code></pre>
<p>Likewise, you can test a single file by passing its path:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">./x.py test tests/ui/const-generics/const-test.rs
</code></pre>
<h3 id="run-only-the-tidy-script"><a class="header" href="#run-only-the-tidy-script">Run only the tidy script</a></h3>
<pre><code class="language-bash">./x.py test tidy
</code></pre>
<h3 id="run-tests-on-the-standard-library"><a class="header" href="#run-tests-on-the-standard-library">Run tests on the standard library</a></h3>
<pre><code class="language-bash">./x.py test --stage 0 library/std
</code></pre>
<p>Note that this only runs tests on <code>std</code>; if you want to test <code>core</code> or other crates,
you have to specify those explicitly.</p>
<h3 id="run-the-tidy-script-and-tests-on-the-standard-library"><a class="header" href="#run-the-tidy-script-and-tests-on-the-standard-library">Run the tidy script and tests on the standard library</a></h3>
<pre><code class="language-bash">./x.py test --stage 0 tidy library/std

<pre><code class="language-bash">./x.py test --stage 1 library/std
</code></pre>
<p>By listing which test suites you want to run you avoid having to run
tests for components you did not change at all.</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Note that bors only runs the tests with the full stage 2
build; therefore, while the tests <strong>usually</strong> work fine with stage 1,
there are some limitations.</p>
<h3 id="run-all-tests-using-a-stage-2-compiler"><a class="header" href="#run-all-tests-using-a-stage-2-compiler">Run all tests using a stage 2 compiler</a></h3>
<pre><code class="language-bash">./x.py test --stage 2
</code></pre>
<p>You almost never need to do this; CI will run these tests for you.</p>
<h2 id="run-unit-tests-on-the-compilerlibrary"><a class="header" href="#run-unit-tests-on-the-compilerlibrary">Run unit tests on the compiler/library</a></h2>
<p>You may want to run unit tests on a specific file with following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">./x.py test compiler/rustc_data_structures/src/thin_vec/tests.rs
</code></pre>
<p>But unfortunately, it's impossible. You should invoke following instead:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">./x.py test compiler/rustc_data_structures/ --test-args thin_vec
</code></pre>
<h2 id="running-an-individual-test"><a class="header" href="#running-an-individual-test">Running an individual test</a></h2>
<p>Another common thing that people want to do is to run an <strong>individual
test</strong>, often the test they are trying to fix. As mentioned earlier,
you may pass the full file path to achieve this, or alternatively one
may invoke <code>x.py</code> with the <code>--test-args</code> option:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">./x.py test tests/ui --test-args issue-1234
</code></pre>
<p>Under the hood, the test runner invokes the standard Rust test runner
(the same one you get with <code>#[test]</code>), so this command would wind up
filtering for tests that include &quot;issue-1234&quot; in the name. (Thus
<code>--test-args</code> is a good way to run a collection of related tests.)</p>
<h2 id="editing-and-updating-the-reference-files"><a class="header" href="#editing-and-updating-the-reference-files">Editing and updating the reference files</a></h2>
<p>If you have changed the compiler's output intentionally, or you are
making a new test, you can pass <code>--bless</code> to the test subcommand. E.g.
if some tests in <code>tests/ui</code> are failing, you can run</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">./x.py test tests/ui --bless
</code></pre>
<p>to automatically adjust the <code>.stderr</code>, <code>.stdout</code> or <code>.fixed</code> files of
all tests. Of course you can also target just specific tests with the
<code>--test-args your_test_name</code> flag, just like when running the tests.</p>
<h2 id="configuring-test-running"><a class="header" href="#configuring-test-running">Configuring test running</a></h2>
<p>There are a few options for running tests:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>config.toml</code> has the <code>rust.verbose-tests</code> option.
If <code>false</code>, each test will print a single dot (the default).
If <code>true</code>, the name of every test will be printed.
This is equivalent to the <code>--quiet</code> option in the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/tests/">Rust test
harness</a></li>
<li>The environment variable <code>RUST_TEST_THREADS</code> can be set to the number of
concurrent threads to use for testing.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="passing---pass-mode"><a class="header" href="#passing---pass-mode">Passing <code>--pass $mode</code></a></h2>
<p>Pass UI tests now have three modes, <code>check-pass</code>, <code>build-pass</code> and
<code>run-pass</code>. When <code>--pass $mode</code> is passed, these tests will be forced
to run under the given <code>$mode</code> unless the directive <code>// ignore-pass</code>
exists in the test file. For example, you can run all the tests in
<code>tests/ui</code> as <code>check-pass</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">./x.py test tests/ui --pass check
</code></pre>
<p>By passing <code>--pass $mode</code>, you can reduce the testing time. For each
mode, please see <a href="tests/ui.html#controlling-passfail-expectations">Controlling pass/fail
expectations</a>.</p>
<h2 id="running-tests-with-different-compare-modes"><a class="header" href="#running-tests-with-different-compare-modes">Running tests with different &quot;compare modes&quot;</a></h2>
<p>UI tests may have different output depending on certain &quot;modes&quot; that
the compiler is in. For example, when using the Polonius
mode, a test <code>foo.rs</code> will first look for expected output in
<code>foo.polonius.stderr</code>, falling back to the usual <code>foo.stderr</code> if not found.
The following will run the UI test suite in Polonius mode:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">./x.py test tests/ui --compare-mode=polonius
</code></pre>
<p>See <a href="tests/compiletest.html#compare-modes">Compare modes</a> for more details.</p>
<h2 id="running-tests-manually"><a class="header" href="#running-tests-manually">Running tests manually</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes it's easier and faster to just run the test by hand.
Most tests are just <code>rs</code> files, so after
<a href="tests/../building/how-to-build-and-run.html#creating-a-rustup-toolchain">creating a rustup toolchain</a>,
you can do something like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">rustc +stage1 tests/ui/issue-1234.rs
</code></pre>
<p>This is much faster, but doesn't always work. For example, some tests
include directives that specify specific compiler flags, or which rely
on other crates, and they may not run the same without those options.</p>
<h2 id="running-tests-on-a-remote-machine"><a class="header" href="#running-tests-on-a-remote-machine">Running tests on a remote machine</a></h2>
<p>Tests may be run on a remote machine (e.g. to test builds for a different
architecture). This is done using <code>remote-test-client</code> on the build machine
to send test programs to <code>remote-test-server</code> running on the remote machine.
<code>remote-test-server</code> executes the test programs and sends the results back to
the build machine. <code>remote-test-server</code> provides <em>unauthenticated remote code
execution</em> so be careful where it is used.</p>
<p>To do this, first build <code>remote-test-server</code> for the remote
machine, e.g. for RISC-V</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">./x.py build src/tools/remote-test-server --target riscv64gc-unknown-linux-gnu
</code></pre>
<p>The binary will be created at
<code>./build/host/stage2-tools/$TARGET_ARCH/release/remote-test-server</code>. Copy
this over to the remote machine.</p>
<p>On the remote machine, run the <code>remote-test-server</code> with the <code>--bind 0.0.0.0:12345</code> flag (and optionally <code>-v</code> for verbose output). Output should
look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ ./remote-test-server -v --bind 0.0.0.0:12345
starting test server
listening on 0.0.0.0:12345!
</code></pre>
<p>Note that binding the server to 0.0.0.0 will allow all hosts able to reach your
machine to execute arbitrary code on your machine. We strongly recommend either
setting up a firewall to block external access to port 12345, or to use a more
restrictive IP address when binding.</p>
<p>You can test if the <code>remote-test-server</code> is working by connecting to it and
sending <code>ping\n</code>. It should reply <code>pong</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">$ nc $REMOTE_IP 12345
ping
pong
</code></pre>
<p>To run tests using the remote runner, set the <code>TEST_DEVICE_ADDR</code> environment
variable then use <code>x.py</code> as usual. For example, to run <code>ui</code> tests for a RISC-V
machine with the IP address <code>1.2.3.4</code> use</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">export TEST_DEVICE_ADDR=&quot;1.2.3.4:12345&quot;
./x.py test tests/ui --target riscv64gc-unknown-linux-gnu
</code></pre>
<p>If <code>remote-test-server</code> was run with the verbose flag, output on the test machine
may look something like</p>
<pre><code>[...]
run &quot;/tmp/work/test1007/a&quot;
run &quot;/tmp/work/test1008/a&quot;
run &quot;/tmp/work/test1009/a&quot;
run &quot;/tmp/work/test1010/a&quot;
run &quot;/tmp/work/test1011/a&quot;
run &quot;/tmp/work/test1012/a&quot;
run &quot;/tmp/work/test1013/a&quot;
run &quot;/tmp/work/test1014/a&quot;
run &quot;/tmp/work/test1015/a&quot;
run &quot;/tmp/work/test1016/a&quot;
run &quot;/tmp/work/test1017/a&quot;
run &quot;/tmp/work/test1018/a&quot;
[...]
</code></pre>
<p>Tests are built on the machine running <code>x.py</code> not on the remote machine. Tests
which fail to build unexpectedly (or <code>ui</code> tests producing incorrect build
output) may fail without ever running on the remote machine.</p>
<h2 id="testing-on-emulators"><a class="header" href="#testing-on-emulators">Testing on emulators</a></h2>
<p>Some platforms are tested via an emulator for architectures that aren't
readily available. For architectures where the standard library is well
supported and the host operating system supports TCP/IP networking, see the
above instructions for testing on a remote machine (in this case the
remote machine is emulated).</p>
<p>There is also a set of tools for orchestrating running the
tests within the emulator. Platforms such as <code>arm-android</code> and
<code>arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf</code> are set up to automatically run the tests under
emulation on GitHub Actions. The following will take a look at how a target's tests
are run under emulation.</p>
<p>The Docker image for <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/ci/docker/host-x86_64/armhf-gnu/Dockerfile">armhf-gnu</a> includes <a href="https://www.qemu.org/">QEMU</a> to emulate the ARM CPU
architecture. Included in the Rust tree are the tools <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/tools/remote-test-client">remote-test-client</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/tools/remote-test-server">remote-test-server</a> which are programs for sending test programs and
libraries to the emulator, and running the tests within the emulator, and
reading the results.  The Docker image is set up to launch
<code>remote-test-server</code> and the build tools use <code>remote-test-client</code> to
communicate with the server to coordinate running tests (see
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/bootstrap/test.rs">src/bootstrap/test.rs</a>).</p>

<p>The Rust tree includes <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> image definitions for the platforms used on
GitHub Actions in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/ci/docker"><code>src/ci/docker</code></a>.
The script <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/ci/docker/run.sh"><code>src/ci/docker/run.sh</code></a> is used to build the Docker image, run it,

<p>You can run these images on your local development machine. This can be
helpful to test environments different from your local system. First you will
need to install Docker on a Linux, Windows, or macOS system (typically Linux
will be much faster than Windows or macOS because the latter use virtual
machines to emulate a Linux environment). To enter interactive mode which will
start a bash shell in the container, run <code>src/ci/docker/run.sh --dev &lt;IMAGE&gt;</code>
where <code>&lt;IMAGE&gt;</code> is one of the directory names in <code>src/ci/docker</code> (for example
<code>x86_64-gnu</code> is a fairly standard Ubuntu environment).</p>
<p>The docker script will mount your local Rust source tree in read-only mode,
and an <code>obj</code> directory in read-write mode. All of the compiler artifacts will
be stored in the <code>obj</code> directory. The shell will start out in the <code>obj</code>
directory. From there, you can run <code>../src/ci/run.sh</code> which will run the build
as defined by the image.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can run individual commands to do specific tasks. For
example, you can run <code>python3 ../x.py test tests/ui</code> to just run UI tests.
Note that there is some configuration in the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/ci/run.sh"><code>src/ci/run.sh</code></a> script that you
may need to recreate. Particularly, set <code>submodules = false</code> in your
<code>config.toml</code> so that it doesn't attempt to modify the read-only directory.</p>
<p>Some additional notes about using the Docker images:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of the std tests require IPv6 support. Docker on Linux seems to have it
disabled by default. Run the commands in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/ci/scripts/enable-docker-ipv6.sh"><code>enable-docker-ipv6.sh</code></a> to enable
IPv6 before creating the container. This only needs to be done once.</li>
<li>The container will be deleted automatically when you exit the shell, however
the build artifacts persist in the <code>obj</code> directory. If you are switching
between different Docker images, the artifacts from previous environments
stored in the <code>obj</code> directory may confuse the build system. Sometimes you
will need to delete parts or all of the <code>obj</code> directory before building
inside the container.</li>
<li>The container is bare-bones, with only a minimal set of packages. You may
want to install some things like <code>apt install less vim</code>.</li>
<li>You can open multiple shells in the container. First you need the container
name (a short hash), which is displayed in the shell prompt, or you can run
<code>docker container ls</code> outside of the container to list the available
containers. With the container name, run <code>docker exec -it &lt;CONTAINER&gt; /bin/bash</code> where <code>&lt;CONTAINER&gt;</code> is the container name like <code>4ba195e95cef</code>.</li>

<p>When a Pull Request is opened on GitHub, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/actions">GitHub Actions</a> will automatically
launch a build that will run all tests on some configurations
(x86_64-gnu-llvm-13 linux, x86_64-gnu-tools linux, and mingw-check linux).
In essence, each runs <code>./x.py test</code> with various different options.</p>
<p>The integration bot <a href="https://github.com/servo/homu">bors</a> is used for coordinating merges to the master branch.
When a PR is approved, it goes into a <a href="https://bors.rust-lang.org/queue/rust">queue</a> where merges are tested one at a
time on a wide set of platforms using GitHub Actions. Due to the limit on the
number of parallel jobs, we run CI under the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang-ci/rust/actions">rust-lang-ci</a> organization except
for PRs.
Most platforms only run the build steps, some run a restricted set of tests,
only a subset run the full suite of tests (see Rust's <a href="https://forge.rust-lang.org/release/platform-support.html#rust-platform-support">platform tiers</a>).</p>
<p>If everything passes, then all of the distribution artifacts that were
generated during the CI run are published.</p>
<h2 id="using-ci-to-test"><a class="header" href="#using-ci-to-test">Using CI to test</a></h2>
<p>In some cases, a PR may run into problems with running tests on a particular
platform or configuration.
If you can't run those tests locally, don't hesitate to use CI resources to
try out a fix.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, opening or updating a PR will only run on a small subset
of configurations.
Only when a PR is approved will it go through the full set of test configurations.
However, you can try one of those configurations in your PR before it is approved.
For example, if a Windows build fails, but you don't have access to a Windows
machine, you can try running the Windows job that failed on CI within your PR
after pushing a possible fix.</p>
<p>To do this, you'll need to edit <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/ci/github-actions/ci.yml"><code>src/ci/github-actions/ci.yml</code></a>.
The <code>jobs</code> section defines the jobs that will run.
The <code>jobs.pr</code> section defines everything that will run in a push to a PR.
The <code>jobs.auto</code> section defines the full set of tests that are run after a PR is approved.
You can copy one of the definitions from the <code>auto</code> section up to the <code>pr</code> section.</p>
<p>For example, the <code>x86_64-msvc-1</code> and <code>x86_64-msvc-2</code> jobs are responsible for
running the 64-bit MSVC tests.
You can copy those up to the <code>jobs.pr.strategy.matrix.include</code> section with
the other jobs.</p>
<p>The comment at the top of <code>ci.yml</code> will tell you to run this command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">./x.py run src/tools/expand-yaml-anchors
</code></pre>
<p>This will generate the true <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci.yml#L1"><code>.github/workflows/ci.yml</code></a> which is what GitHub
Actions uses.</p>
<p>Then, you can commit those two files and push to GitHub.
GitHub Actions should launch the tests.</p>
<p>After you have finished, don't forget to remove any changes you have made to <code>ci.yml</code>.</p>
<p>Although you are welcome to use CI, just be conscientious that this is a shared
resource with limited concurrency.
Try not to enable too many jobs at once (one or two should be sufficient in
most cases).</p>

<p><strong>In general, we expect every PR that fixes a bug in rustc to come
accompanied by a regression test of some kind.</strong> This test should fail
in master but pass after the PR. These tests are really useful for
preventing us from repeating the mistakes of the past.</p>
<p>The first thing to decide is which kind of test to add.
This will depend on the nature of the change and what you want to exercise.
Here are some rough guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>The majority of compiler tests are done with <a href="tests/compiletest.html">compiletest</a>.
<ul>
<li>The majority of compiletest tests are <a href="tests/ui.html">UI</a> tests in the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/tests/ui/"><code>tests/ui</code></a> directory.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Changes to the standard library are usually tested within the standard library itself.
<ul>
<li>The majority of standard library tests are written as doctests,
which illustrate and exercise typical API behavior.</li>
<li>Additional <a href="tests/intro.html#package-tests">unit tests</a> should go in
<code>library/${crate}/tests</code> (where <code>${crate}</code> is usually <code>core</code>, <code>alloc</code>, or <code>std</code>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the code is part of an isolated system, and you are not testing compiler output,
consider using a <a href="tests/intro.html#package-tests">unit or integration test</a>.</li>
<li>Need to run rustdoc? Prefer a <code>rustdoc</code> or <code>rustdoc-ui</code> test.
Occasionally you'll need <code>rustdoc-js</code> as well.</li>
<li>Other compiletest test suites are generally used for special purposes:
<ul>
<li>Need to run gdb or lldb? Use the <code>debuginfo</code> test suite.</li>
<li>Need to inspect LLVM IR or MIR IR? Use the <code>codegen</code> or <code>mir-opt</code> test suites.</li>
<li>Need to inspect the resulting binary in some way?
Then use <code>run-make</code>.</li>
<li>Check out the <a href="tests/compiletest.html">compiletest</a> chapter for more specialized test suites.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ui-test-walkthrough"><a class="header" href="#ui-test-walkthrough">UI test walkthrough</a></h2>
<p>The following is a basic guide for creating a <a href="tests/ui.html">UI test</a>, which is one
of the most common compiler tests.
For this tutorial, we'll be adding a test for an async error message.</p>
<h3 id="step-1-add-a-test-file"><a class="header" href="#step-1-add-a-test-file">Step 1. Add a test file</a></h3>
<p>The first step is to create a Rust source file somewhere in the
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/tests/ui/"><code>tests/ui</code></a> tree.
When creating a test, do your best to find a good location and name (see <a href="tests/ui.html#test-organization">Test
organization</a> for more).
Since naming is the hardest part of development, everything should be downhill
from here!</p>
<p>Let's place our async test at <code>tests/ui/async-await/await-without-async.rs</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">// Check what happens when using await in a non-async fn.
// edition:2018

async fn foo() {}

fn bar() {
    foo().await
}

fn main() {}
</code></pre>
<p>A few things to notice about our test:</p>
<ul>
<li>The top should start with a short comment that <a href="tests/adding.html#explanatory_comment">explains what the test is
for</a>.</li>
<li>The <code>// edition:2018</code> comment is called a <a href="tests/headers.html">header</a> which provides
instructions to compiletest on how to build the test.
Here we need to set the edition for <code>async</code> to work (the default is 2015).</li>
<li>Following that is the source of the test.
Try to keep it succinct and to the point.
This may require some effort if you are trying to minimize an example from a
bug report.</li>
<li>We end this test with an empty <code>fn main</code> function.
This is because the default for UI tests is a <code>bin</code> crate-type,
and we don't want the &quot;main not found&quot; error in our test.
Alternatively, you could add <code>#![crate_type=&quot;lib&quot;]</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="step-2-generate-the-expected-output"><a class="header" href="#step-2-generate-the-expected-output">Step 2. Generate the expected output</a></h3>
<p>The next step is to create the expected output from the compiler.
This can be done with the <code>--bless</code> option:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">./x.py test tests/ui/async-await/await-without-async.rs --bless
</code></pre>
<p>This will build the compiler (if it hasn't already been built), compile the
test, and place the output of the compiler in a file called
<code>tests/ui/async-await/await-without-async.stderr</code>.</p>
<p>However, this step will fail!
You should see an error message, something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>error: /rust/tests/ui/async-await/await-without-async.rs:7: unexpected
error: '7:10: 7:16: <code>await</code> is only allowed inside <code>async</code> functions and
blocks E0728'</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="step-3-add-error-annotations"><a class="header" href="#step-3-add-error-annotations">Step 3. Add error annotations</a></h3>
<p>Every error needs to be annotated with a comment in the source with the text
of the error.
In this case, we can add the following comment to our test file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn bar() {
    foo().await
//~^ ERROR `await` is only allowed inside `async` functions and blocks
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>//~^</code> squiggle caret comment tells compiletest that the error belongs to
the previous line (more on this in the <a href="tests/ui.html#error-annotations">Error
annotations</a> section).</p>
<p>Save that, and run the test again:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">./x.py test tests/ui/async-await/await-without-async.rs
</code></pre>
<p>It should now pass, yay!</p>
<h3 id="step-4-review-the-output"><a class="header" href="#step-4-review-the-output">Step 4. Review the output</a></h3>
<p>Somewhat hand-in-hand with the previous step, you should inspect the <code>.stderr</code>
file that was created to see if it looks like how you expect.
If you are adding a new diagnostic message, now would be a good time to
also consider how readable the message looks overall, particularly for
people new to Rust.</p>
<p>Our example <code>tests/ui/async-await/await-without-async.stderr</code> file should
look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0728]: `await` is only allowed inside `async` functions and blocks
  --&gt; $DIR/await-without-async.rs:7:10
   |
LL | fn bar() {
   |    --- this is not `async`
LL |     foo().await
   |          ^^^^^^ only allowed inside `async` functions and blocks

error: aborting due to previous error

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0728`.
</code></pre>
<p>You may notice some things look a little different than the regular
compiler output.
The <code>$DIR</code> removes the path information which will differ between systems.
The <code>LL</code> values replace the line numbers.
That helps avoid small changes in the source from triggering large diffs.
See the <a href="tests/ui.html#normalization">Normalization</a> section for more.</p>
<p>Around this stage, you may need to iterate over the last few steps a few times
to tweak your test, re-bless the test, and re-review the output.</p>
<h3 id="step-5-check-other-tests"><a class="header" href="#step-5-check-other-tests">Step 5. Check other tests</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes when adding or changing a diagnostic message, this will affect
other tests in the test suite.
The final step before posting a PR is to check if you have affected anything else.
Running the UI suite is usually a good start:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">./x.py test tests/ui
</code></pre>
<p>If other tests start failing, you may need to investigate what has changed
and if the new output makes sense.
You may also need to re-bless the output with the <code>--bless</code> flag.</p>
<p><a name="explanatory_comment"></a></p>
<h2 id="comment-explaining-what-the-test-is-about"><a class="header" href="#comment-explaining-what-the-test-is-about">Comment explaining what the test is about</a></h2>
<p>The first comment of a test file should <strong>summarize the point
of the test</strong>, and highlight what is important about it.
If there is an issue number associated with the test, include
the issue number.</p>
<p>This comment doesn't have to be super extensive. Just something like
&quot;Regression test for #18060: match arms were matching in the wrong
order.&quot;  might already be enough.</p>
<p>These comments are very useful to others later on when your test
breaks, since they often can highlight what the problem is. They are
also useful if for some reason the tests need to be refactored, since
they let others know which parts of the test were important (often a
test must be rewritten because it no longer tests what is was meant to
test, and then it's useful to know what it <em>was</em> meant to test
exactly).</p>

<p><code>compiletest</code> is the main test harness of the Rust test suite.
It allows test authors to organize large numbers of tests
(the Rust compiler has many thousands),
efficient test execution (parallel execution is supported),
and allows the test author to configure behavior and expected results of both
individual and groups of tests.</p>
<p><code>compiletest</code> may check test code for success, for runtime failure,
or for compile-time failure.
Tests are typically organized as a Rust source file with annotations in
comments before and/or within the test code.
These comments serve to direct <code>compiletest</code> on if or how to run the test,
what behavior to expect, and more.
See <a href="tests/headers.html">header commands</a> and the test suite documentation below
for more details on these annotations.</p>
<p>See the <a href="tests/adding.html">Adding new tests</a> chapter for a tutorial on creating a new
test, and the <a href="tests/running.html">Running tests</a> chapter on how to run the test
suite.</p>
<p>Compiletest itself tries to avoid running tests when the artifacts
that are involved (mainly the compiler) haven't changed. You can use
<code>x test --test-args --force-rerun</code> to rerun a test even when none of the
inputs have changed.</p>
<h2 id="test-suites"><a class="header" href="#test-suites">Test suites</a></h2>
<p>All of the tests are in the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/tests"><code>tests</code></a> directory.
The tests are organized into &quot;suites&quot;, with each suite in a separate subdirectory.
Each test suite behaves a little differently, with different compiler behavior
and different checks for correctness.
For example, the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/tests/incremental"><code>tests/incremental</code></a> directory contains tests for
incremental compilation.
The various suites are defined in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/tools/compiletest/src/common.rs"><code>src/tools/compiletest/src/common.rs</code></a> in
the <code>pub enum Mode</code> declaration.</p>
<p>The following test suites are available, with links for more information:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="tests/ui.html"><code>ui</code></a> — tests that check the stdout/stderr from the compilation
and/or running the resulting executable</li>
<li><code>ui-fulldeps</code> — <code>ui</code> tests which require a linkable build of <code>rustc</code> (such
as using <code>extern crate rustc_span;</code> or used as a plugin)</li>
<li><a href="tests/compiletest.html#pretty-printer-tests"><code>pretty</code></a> — tests for pretty printing</li>

<h3 id="pretty-printer-tests"><a class="header" href="#pretty-printer-tests">Pretty-printer tests</a></h3>
<p>The tests in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/tests/pretty"><code>tests/pretty</code></a> exercise the &quot;pretty-printing&quot; functionality of <code>rustc</code>.
The <code>-Z unpretty</code> CLI option for <code>rustc</code> causes it to translate the input source
into various different formats, such as the Rust source after macro expansion.</p>
<p>The pretty-printer tests have several <a href="tests/headers.html">header commands</a> described below.
These commands can significantly change the behavior of the test, but the
default behavior without any commands is to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Run <code>rustc -Zunpretty=normal</code> on the source file</li>
<li>Run <code>rustc -Zunpretty=normal</code> on the output of the previous step</li>
<li>The output of the previous two steps should be the same.</li>
<li>Run <code>rustc -Zno-codegen</code> on the output to make sure that it can type check
(this is similar to running <code>cargo check</code>)</li>
</ol>
<p>If any of the commands above fail, then the test fails.</p>
<p>The header commands for pretty-printing tests are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>pretty-mode</code> specifies the mode pretty-print tests should run in
(that is, the argument to <code>-Zunpretty</code>).
The default is <code>normal</code> if not specified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>pretty-compare-only</code> causes a pretty test to only compare the pretty-printed output
(stopping after step 3 from above).
It will not try to compile the expanded output to type check it.
This is needed for a pretty-mode that does not expand to valid
Rust, or for other situations where the expanded output cannot be compiled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>pretty-expanded</code> allows a pretty test to also check that the expanded
output can be type checked.
That is, after the steps above, it does two more steps:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol start="5">
<li>Run <code>rustc -Zunpretty=expanded</code> on the original source</li>
<li>Run <code>rustc -Zno-codegen</code> on the expanded output to make sure that it can type check</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>This is needed because not all code can be compiled after being expanded.
Pretty tests should specify this if they can.
An example where this cannot be used is if the test includes <code>println!</code>.
That macro expands to reference private internal functions of the standard
library that cannot be called directly without the <code>fmt_internals</code> feature
gate.</p>
<p>More history about this may be found in
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/23616#issuecomment-484999901">#23616</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>pp-exact</code> is used to ensure a pretty-print test results in specific output.
If specified without a value, then it means the pretty-print output should
match the original source.
If specified with a value, as in <code>// pp-exact:foo.pp</code>,
it will ensure that the pretty-printed output matches the contents of the given file.
Otherwise, if <code>pp-exact</code> is not specified, then the pretty-printed output
will be pretty-printed one more time, and the output of the two
pretty-printing rounds will be compared to ensure that the pretty-printed
output converges to a steady state.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="incremental-tests"><a class="header" href="#incremental-tests">Incremental tests</a></h3>
<p>The tests in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/tests/incremental"><code>tests/incremental</code></a> exercise incremental compilation.
They use <a href="tests/compiletest.html#revisions">revision headers</a> to tell compiletest to run the
compiler in a series of steps.
Compiletest starts with an empty directory with the <code>-C incremental</code> flag, and
then runs the compiler for each revision, reusing the incremental results from
previous steps.
The revisions should start with:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rpass</code> — the test should compile and run successfully</li>
<li><code>rfail</code> — the test should compile successfully, but the executable should fail to run</li>
<li><code>cfail</code> — the test should fail to compile</li>
</ul>
<p>To make the revisions unique, you should add a suffix like <code>rpass1</code> and <code>rpass2</code>.</p>
<p>To simulate changing the source, compiletest also passes a <code>--cfg</code> flag with
the current revision name.
For example, this will run twice, simulating changing a function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">// revisions: rpass1 rpass2

#[cfg(rpass1)]
fn foo() {
    println!(&quot;one&quot;);
}

#[cfg(rpass2)]
fn foo() {
    println!(&quot;two&quot;);
}

fn main() { foo(); }
</code></pre>
<p><code>cfail</code> tests support the <code>forbid-output</code> header to specify that a certain
substring must not appear anywhere in the compiler output.
This can be useful to ensure certain errors do not appear, but this can be
fragile as error messages change over time, and a test may no longer be
checking the right thing but will still pass.</p>
<p><code>cfail</code> tests support the <code>should-ice</code> header to specify that a test should
cause an Internal Compiler Error (ICE).
This is a highly specialized header to check that the incremental cache
continues to work after an ICE.</p>
<h3 id="debuginfo-tests"><a class="header" href="#debuginfo-tests">Debuginfo tests</a></h3>
<p>The tests in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/tests/debuginfo"><code>tests/debuginfo</code></a> test debuginfo generation.
They build a program, launch a debugger, and issue commands to the debugger.
A single test can work with cdb, gdb, and lldb.</p>
<p>Most tests should have the <code>// compile-flags: -g</code> header or something similar
to generate the appropriate debuginfo.</p>
<p>To set a breakpoint on a line, add a <code>// #break</code> comment on the line.</p>
<p>The debuginfo tests consist of a series of debugger commands along with
&quot;check&quot; lines which specify output that is expected from the debugger.</p>
<p>The commands are comments of the form <code>// $DEBUGGER-command:$COMMAND</code> where
<code>$DEBUGGER</code> is the debugger being used and <code>$COMMAND</code> is the debugger command
to execute.
The debugger values can be:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>cdb</code></li>
<li><code>gdb</code></li>
<li><code>gdbg</code> — GDB without Rust support (versions older than 7.11)</li>
<li><code>gdbr</code> — GDB with Rust support</li>
<li><code>lldb</code></li>
<li><code>lldbg</code> — LLDB without Rust support</li>
<li><code>lldbr</code> — LLDB with Rust support (this no longer exists)</li>
</ul>
<p>The command to check the output are of the form <code>// $DEBUGGER-check:$OUTPUT</code>
where <code>$OUTPUT</code> is the output to expect.</p>
<p>For example, the following will build the test, start the debugger, set a
breakpoint, launch the program, inspect a value, and check what the debugger
prints:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">// compile-flags: -g

// lldb-command: run
// lldb-command: print foo
// lldb-check: $0 = 123

fn main() {
    let foo = 123;
    b(); // #break
}

fn b() {}
</code></pre>
<p>The following <a href="tests/headers.html">header commands</a> are available to disable a
test based on the debugger currently being used:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>min-cdb-version: 10.0.18317.1001</code> — ignores the test if the version of cdb
is below the given version</li>
<li><code>min-gdb-version: 8.2</code> — ignores the test if the version of gdb is below the
given version</li>
<li><code>ignore-gdb-version: 9.2</code> — ignores the test if the version of gdb is equal
to the given version</li>
<li><code>ignore-gdb-version: 7.11.90 - 8.0.9</code> — ignores the test if the version of
gdb is in a range (inclusive)</li>
<li><code>min-lldb-version: 310</code> — ignores the test if the version of lldb is below
the given version</li>
<li><code>rust-lldb</code> — ignores the test if lldb is not contain the Rust plugin.
NOTE: The &quot;Rust&quot; version of LLDB doesn't exist anymore, so this will always be ignored.
This should probably be removed.</li>
</ul>

<p>The tests in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/tests/codegen"><code>tests/codegen</code></a> test LLVM code generation.
They compile the test with the <code>--emit=llvm-ir</code> flag to emit LLVM IR.
They then run the LLVM <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/FileCheck.html">FileCheck</a> tool.
The test is annotated with various <code>// CHECK</code> comments to check the generated code.
See the FileCheck documentation for a tutorial and more information.</p>

<p>The tests in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/tests/assembly"><code>tests/assembly</code></a> test LLVM assembly output.
They compile the test with the <code>--emit=asm</code> flag to emit a <code>.s</code> file with the

They then run the LLVM <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/FileCheck.html">FileCheck</a> tool.</p>
<p>Each test should be annotated with the <code>// assembly-output:</code> header

<h3 id="codegen-units-tests"><a class="header" href="#codegen-units-tests">Codegen-units tests</a></h3>
<p>The tests in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/tests/codegen-units"><code>tests/codegen-units</code></a> test the
<a href="tests/../backend/monomorph.html">monomorphization</a> collector and CGU partitioning.</p>
<p>These tests work by running <code>rustc</code> with a flag to print the result of the
monomorphization collection pass, and then special annotations in the file are
used to compare against that.</p>
<p>Each test should be annotated with the <code>// compile-flags:-Zprint-mono-items=VAL</code>
header with the appropriate VAL to instruct <code>rustc</code> to print the
monomorphization information.</p>
<p>Then, the test should be annotated with comments of the form <code>//~ MONO_ITEM name</code>
where <code>name</code> is the monomorphized string printed by rustc like <code>fn &lt;u32 as Trait&gt;::foo</code>.</p>
<p>To check for CGU partitioning, a comment of the form <code>//~ MONO_ITEM name @@ cgu</code>
where <code>cgu</code> is a space separated list of the CGU names and the linkage
information in brackets.
For example: <code>//~ MONO_ITEM static function::FOO @@ statics[Internal]</code></p>
<h3 id="mir-opt-tests"><a class="header" href="#mir-opt-tests">Mir-opt tests</a></h3>
<p>The tests in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/tests/mir-opt"><code>tests/mir-opt</code></a> check parts of the generated MIR to make
sure it is generated correctly and is doing the expected optimizations.
Check out the <a href="tests/../mir/optimizations.html">MIR Optimizations</a> chapter for more.</p>
<p>Compiletest will build the test with several flags to dump the MIR output and
set a baseline for optimizations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-Copt-level=1</code></li>
<li><code>-Zdump-mir=all</code></li>
<li><code>-Zmir-opt-level=4</code></li>
<li><code>-Zvalidate-mir</code></li>
<li><code>-Zdump-mir-exclude-pass-number</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The test should be annotated with <code>// EMIT_MIR</code> comments that specify files that
will contain the expected MIR output.
You can use <code>x.py test --bless</code> to create the initial expected files.</p>
<p>There are several forms the <code>EMIT_MIR</code> comment can take:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>// EMIT_MIR $MIR_PATH.mir</code> — This will check that the given filename
matches the exact output from the MIR dump.
For example, <code>my_test.main.SimplifyCfg-elaborate-drops.after.mir</code> will load
that file from the test directory, and compare it against the dump from
rustc.</p>
<p>Checking the &quot;after&quot; file (which is after optimization) is useful if you are
interested in the final state after an optimization.
Some rare cases may want to use the &quot;before&quot; file for completeness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>// EMIT_MIR $MIR_PATH.diff</code> — where <code>$MIR_PATH</code> is the filename of the MIR
dump, such as <code>my_test_name.my_function.EarlyOtherwiseBranch</code>.
Compiletest will diff the <code>.before.mir</code> and <code>.after.mir</code> files, and compare
the diff output to the expected <code>.diff</code> file from the <code>EMIT_MIR</code> comment.</p>
<p>This is useful if you want to see how an optimization changes the MIR.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>// EMIT_MIR $MIR_PATH.dot</code> or <code>$MIR_PATH.html</code> — These are special cases
for other MIR outputs (via <code>-Z dump-mir-graphviz</code> and <code>-Z dump-mir-spanview</code>)
that will check that the output matches the given file.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By default 32 bit and 64 bit targets use the same dump files, which can be
problematic in the presence of pointers in constants or other bit width
dependent things. In that case you can add <code>// EMIT_MIR_FOR_EACH_BIT_WIDTH</code> to
your test, causing separate files to be generated for 32bit and 64bit systems.</p>
<h3 id="run-make-tests"><a class="header" href="#run-make-tests">Run-make tests</a></h3>
<p>The tests in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/tests/run-make"><code>tests/run-make</code></a> are general-purpose tests using Makefiles
which provide the ultimate in flexibility.
These should be used as a last resort.
If possible, you should use one of the other test suites.
If there is some minor feature missing which you need for your test,
consider extending compiletest to add a header command for what you need.
However, sometimes just running a bunch of commands is really what you
need, <code>run-make</code> is here to the rescue!</p>
<p>Each test should be in a separate directory with a <code>Makefile</code> indicating the
commands to run.
There is a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/tests/run-make-fulldeps/tools.mk"><code>tools.mk</code></a> Makefile which you can include which provides a bunch of
utilities to make it easier to run commands and compare outputs.
Take a look at some of the other tests for some examples on how to get started.</p>
<h3 id="valgrind-tests"><a class="header" href="#valgrind-tests">Valgrind tests</a></h3>

These are currently vestigial, as Valgrind is no longer used in CI.
These may be removed in the future.</p>
<h2 id="building-auxiliary-crates"><a class="header" href="#building-auxiliary-crates">Building auxiliary crates</a></h2>
<p>It is common that some tests require additional auxiliary crates to be compiled.
There are two <a href="tests/headers.html">headers</a> to assist with that:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>aux-build</code></li>
<li><code>aux-crate</code></li>
</ul>
<p><code>aux-build</code> will build a separate crate from the named source file.
The source file should be in a directory called <code>auxiliary</code> beside the test file.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">// aux-build: my-helper.rs

extern crate my_helper;
// ... You can use my_helper.
</code></pre>
<p>The aux crate will be built as a dylib if possible (unless on a platform that
does not support them, or the <code>no-prefer-dynamic</code> header is specified in the
aux file).
The <code>-L</code> flag is used to find the extern crates.</p>
<p><code>aux-crate</code> is very similar to <code>aux-build</code>; however, it uses the <code>--extern</code>
flag to link to the extern crate.
That allows you to specify the additional syntax of the <code>--extern</code> flag, such
as renaming a dependency.
For example, <code>// aux-crate:foo=bar.rs</code> will compile <code>auxiliary/bar.rs</code> and
make it available under then name <code>foo</code> within the test.
This is similar to how Cargo does dependency renaming.</p>
<h3 id="auxiliary-proc-macro"><a class="header" href="#auxiliary-proc-macro">Auxiliary proc-macro</a></h3>
<p>If you want a proc-macro dependency, then there currently is some ceremony
needed.
Place the proc-macro itself in a file like <code>auxiliary/my-proc-macro.rs</code>
with the following structure:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">// force-host
// no-prefer-dynamic

#![crate_type = &quot;proc-macro&quot;]

extern crate proc_macro;
use proc_macro::TokenStream;

#[proc_macro]
pub fn foo(input: TokenStream) -&gt; TokenStream {
    &quot;&quot;.parse().unwrap()
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>force-host</code> is needed because proc-macros are loaded in the host
compiler, and <code>no-prefer-dynamic</code> is needed to tell compiletest to not use
<code>prefer-dynamic</code> which is not compatible with proc-macros.
The <code>#![crate_type]</code> attribute is needed to specify the correct crate-type.</p>
<p>Then in your test, you can build with with <code>aux-build</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">// aux-build: my-proc-macro.rs

extern crate my_proc_macro;

fn main() {
    my_proc_macro::foo!();
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="revisions"><a class="header" href="#revisions">Revisions</a></h2>
<p>Certain classes of tests support &quot;revisions&quot; (as of <!-- date-check --> July 2022,
this includes UI, assembly, codegen, debuginfo, incremental, and rustdoc UI tests,
though incremental tests are somewhat different).
Revisions allow a single test file to be used for multiple tests.
This is done by adding a special header at the top of the file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">// revisions: foo bar baz
</code></pre>
<p>This will result in the test being compiled (and tested) three times,
once with <code>--cfg foo</code>, once with <code>--cfg bar</code>, and once with <code>--cfg baz</code>.
You can therefore use <code>#[cfg(foo)]</code> etc within the test to tweak
each of these results.</p>
<p>You can also customize headers and expected error messages to a particular
revision. To do this, add <code>[foo]</code> (or <code>bar</code>, <code>baz</code>, etc) after the <code>//</code>
comment, like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">// A flag to pass in only for cfg `foo`:
//[foo]compile-flags: -Z verbose

#[cfg(foo)]
fn test_foo() {
    let x: usize = 32_u32; //[foo]~ ERROR mismatched types
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note that not all headers have meaning when customized to a revision.
For example, the <code>ignore-test</code> header (and all &quot;ignore&quot; headers)
currently only apply to the test as a whole, not to particular
revisions. The only headers that are intended to really work when
customized to a revision are error patterns and compiler flags.</p>
<h2 id="compare-modes"><a class="header" href="#compare-modes">Compare modes</a></h2>
<p>Compiletest can be run in different modes, called <em>compare modes</em>, which can
be used to compare the behavior of all tests with different compiler flags
enabled.
This can help highlight what differences might appear with certain flags, and
check for any problems that might arise.</p>
<p>To run the tests in a different mode, you need to pass the <code>--compare-mode</code>
CLI flag:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">./x.py test tests/ui --compare-mode=chalk
</code></pre>
<p>The possible compare modes are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>polonius</code> — Runs with Polonius with <code>-Zpolonius</code>.</li>
<li><code>chalk</code> — Runs with Chalk with <code>-Zchalk</code>.</li>
<li><code>split-dwarf</code> — Runs with unpacked split-DWARF with <code>-Csplit-debuginfo=unpacked</code>.</li>
<li><code>split-dwarf-single</code> — Runs with packed split-DWARF with <code>-Csplit-debuginfo=packed</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>See <a href="tests/ui.html#compare-modes">UI compare modes</a> for more information about how UI
tests support different output for different modes.</p>
<p>In CI, compare modes are only used in one Linux builder, and only with the
following settings:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>tests/debuginfo</code>: Uses <code>split-dwarf</code> mode.
This helps ensure that none of the debuginfo tests are affected when
enabling split-DWARF.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that compare modes are separate to <a href="tests/compiletest.html#revisions">revisions</a>.
All revisions are tested when running <code>./x.py test tests/ui</code>, however
compare-modes must be manually run individually via the <code>--compare-mode</code> flag.</p>

<p>UI tests are a particular <a href="tests/compiletest.html#test-suites">test suite</a> of compiletest.</p>
<h2 id="introduction-1"><a class="header" href="#introduction-1">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>The tests in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/tests/ui"><code>tests/ui</code></a> are a collection of general-purpose tests which
primarily focus on validating the console output of the compiler, but can be
used for many other purposes.
For example, tests can also be configured to <a href="tests/ui.html#controlling-passfail-expectations">run the resulting
program</a> to verify its behavior.</p>
<h2 id="general-structure-of-a-test"><a class="header" href="#general-structure-of-a-test">General structure of a test</a></h2>
<p>A test consists of a Rust source file located anywhere in the <code>tests/ui</code> directory.
For example, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/tests/ui/hello.rs"><code>tests/ui/hello.rs</code></a> is a basic hello-world test.</p>
<p>Compiletest will use <code>rustc</code> to compile the test, and compare the output
against the expected output which is stored in a <code>.stdout</code> or <code>.stderr</code> file
located next to the test.
See <a href="tests/ui.html#output-comparison">Output comparison</a> for more.</p>
<p>Additionally, errors and warnings should be annotated with comments within
the source file.
See <a href="tests/ui.html#error-annotations">Error annotations</a> for more.</p>
<p><a href="tests/headers.html">Headers</a> in the form of comments at the top of the file control
how the test is compiled and what the expected behavior is.</p>
<p>Tests are expected to fail to compile, since most tests are testing compiler
errors.
You can change that behavior with a header, see <a href="tests/ui.html#controlling-passfail-expectations">Controlling pass/fail
expectations</a>.</p>
<p>By default, a test is built as an executable binary.
If you need a different crate type, you can use the <code>#![crate_type]</code> attribute
to set it as needed.</p>
<h2 id="output-comparison"><a class="header" href="#output-comparison">Output comparison</a></h2>
<p>UI tests store the expected output from the compiler in <code>.stderr</code> and
<code>.stdout</code> files next to the test.
You normally generate these files with the <code>--bless</code> CLI option, and then
inspect them manually to verify they contain what you expect.</p>
<p>The output is normalized to ignore unwanted differences, see the
<a href="tests/ui.html#normalization">Normalization</a> section.
If the file is missing, then compiletest expects the corresponding output to
be empty.</p>
<p>There can be multiple stdout/stderr files.
The general form is:</p>
<p><em>test-name</em><code>.</code><em>revision</em><code>.</code><em>compare_mode</em><code>.</code><em>extension</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>revision</em> is the <a href="tests/ui.html#cfg-revisions">revision</a> name.
This is not included when not using revisions.</li>
<li><em>compare_mode</em> is the <a href="tests/ui.html#compare-modes">compare mode</a>.
This will only be checked when the given compare mode is active.
If the file does not exist, then compiletest will check for a file without
the compare mode.</li>
<li><em>extension</em> is the kind of output being checked:
<ul>
<li><code>stderr</code> — compiler stderr</li>
<li><code>stdout</code> — compiler stdout</li>
<li><code>run.stderr</code> — stderr when running the test</li>
<li><code>run.stdout</code> — stdout when running the test</li>
<li><code>64bit.stderr</code> — compiler stderr with <code>stderr-per-bitwidth</code> header on a 64-bit target</li>
<li><code>32bit.stderr</code> — compiler stderr with <code>stderr-per-bitwidth</code> header on a 32-bit target</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A simple example would be <code>foo.stderr</code> next to a <code>foo.rs</code> test.
A more complex example would be <code>foo.my-revision.polonius.stderr</code>.</p>
<p>There are several <a href="tests/headers.html">headers</a> which will change how compiletest will
check for output files:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>stderr-per-bitwidth</code> — checks separate output files based on the target
pointer width. Consider using the <code>normalize-stderr</code> header instead (see
<a href="tests/ui.html#normalization">Normalization</a>).</li>
<li><code>dont-check-compiler-stderr</code> — Ignores stderr from the compiler.</li>
<li><code>dont-check-compiler-stdout</code> — Ignores stdout from the compiler.</li>
</ul>
<p>UI tests run with with <code>-Zdeduplicate-diagnostics=no</code> flag which disables
rustc's built-in diagnostic deduplication mechanism.
This means you may see some duplicate messages in the output.
This helps illuminate situations where duplicate diagnostics are being
generated.</p>
<h3 id="normalization"><a class="header" href="#normalization">Normalization</a></h3>
<p>The compiler output is normalized to eliminate output difference between
platforms, mainly about filenames.</p>
<p>Compiletest makes the following replacements on the compiler output:</p>
<ul>
<li>The directory where the test is defined is replaced with <code>$DIR</code>.
Example: <code>/path/to/rust/tests/ui/error-codes</code></li>
<li>The directory to the standard library source is replaced with <code>$SRC_DIR</code>.
Example: <code>/path/to/rust/library</code></li>
<li>Line and column numbers for paths in <code>$SRC_DIR</code> are replaced with <code>LL:COL</code>.
This helps ensure that changes to the layout of the standard library do not
cause widespread changes to the <code>.stderr</code> files.
Example: <code>$SRC_DIR/alloc/src/sync.rs:53:46</code></li>
<li>The base directory where the test's output goes is replaced with <code>$TEST_BUILD_DIR</code>.
This only comes up in a few rare circumstances.
Example: <code>/path/to/rust/build/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/test/ui</code></li>
<li>Tabs are replaced with <code>\t</code>.</li>
<li>Backslashes (<code>\</code>) are converted to forward slashes (<code>/</code>) within paths (using
a heuristic). This helps normalize differences with Windows-style paths.</li>
<li>CRLF newlines are converted to LF.</li>
<li>Error line annotations like <code>//~ ERROR some message</code> are removed.</li>
<li>Various v0 and legacy symbol hashes are replaced with placeholders like
<code>[HASH]</code> or <code>&lt;SYMBOL_HASH&gt;</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, the compiler is run with the <code>-Z ui-testing</code> flag which causes
the compiler itself to apply some changes to the diagnostic output to make it
more suitable for UI testing.
For example, it will anonymize line numbers in the output (line numbers
prefixing each source line are replaced with <code>LL</code>).
In extremely rare situations, this mode can be disabled with the header
command <code>// compile-flags: -Z ui-testing=no</code>.</p>
<p>Note: The line and column numbers for <code>--&gt;</code> lines pointing to the test are
<em>not</em> normalized, and left as-is. This ensures that the compiler continues
to point to the correct location, and keeps the stderr files readable.
Ideally all line/column information would be retained, but small changes to
the source causes large diffs, and more frequent merge conflicts and test
errors.</p>
<p>Sometimes these built-in normalizations are not enough. In such cases, you
may provide custom normalization rules using the header commands, e.g.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">// normalize-stdout-test: &quot;foo&quot; -&gt; &quot;bar&quot;
// normalize-stderr-32bit: &quot;fn\(\) \(32 bits\)&quot; -&gt; &quot;fn\(\) \($$PTR bits\)&quot;
// normalize-stderr-64bit: &quot;fn\(\) \(64 bits\)&quot; -&gt; &quot;fn\(\) \($$PTR bits\)&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>This tells the test, on 32-bit platforms, whenever the compiler writes
<code>fn() (32 bits)</code> to stderr, it should be normalized to read <code>fn() ($PTR bits)</code>
instead. Similar for 64-bit. The replacement is performed by regexes using
default regex flavor provided by <code>regex</code> crate.</p>
<p>The corresponding reference file will use the normalized output to test both
32-bit and 64-bit platforms:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">...
   |
   = note: source type: fn() ($PTR bits)
   = note: target type: u16 (16 bits)
...
</code></pre>
<p>Please see <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/tests/ui/transmute/main.rs"><code>ui/transmute/main.rs</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/tests/ui/transmute/main.stderr"><code>main.stderr</code></a> for a
concrete usage example.</p>
<p>Besides <code>normalize-stderr-32bit</code> and <code>-64bit</code>, one may use any target
information or stage supported by <a href="tests/headers.html#ignoring-tests"><code>ignore-X</code></a>
here as well (e.g. <code>normalize-stderr-windows</code> or simply
<code>normalize-stderr-test</code> for unconditional replacement).</p>
<h2 id="error-annotations"><a class="header" href="#error-annotations">Error annotations</a></h2>
<p>Error annotations specify the errors that the compiler is expected to emit.
They are &quot;attached&quot; to the line in source where the error is located.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn main() {
    boom  //~ ERROR cannot find value `boom` in this scope [E0425]
}
</code></pre>
<p>Although UI tests have a <code>.stderr</code> file which contains the entire compiler output,
UI tests require that errors are also annotated within the source.
This redundancy helps avoid mistakes since the <code>.stderr</code> files are usually
auto-generated.
It also helps to directly see where the error spans are expected to point to
by looking at one file instead of having to compare the <code>.stderr</code> file with
the source.
Finally, they ensure that no additional unexpected errors are generated.</p>
<p>They have several forms, but generally are a comment with the diagnostic
level (such as <code>ERROR</code>) and a substring of the expected error output.
You don't have to write out the entire message, just make sure to include the
important part of the message to make it self-documenting.</p>
<p>The error annotation needs to match with the line of the diagnostic.
There are several ways to match the message with the line (see the examples below):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>~</code>: Associates the error level and message with the current line</li>
<li><code>~^</code>: Associates the error level and message with the previous error
annotation line.
Each caret (<code>^</code>) that you add adds a line to this, so <code>~^^^</code> is three lines
above the error annotation line.</li>
<li><code>~|</code>: Associates the error level and message with the same line as the
previous comment.
This is more convenient than using multiple carets when there are multiple
messages associated with the same line.</li>
</ul>
<p>The space character between <code>//~</code> (or other variants) and the subsequent text
is negligible (i.e. there is no semantic difference between <code>//~ ERROR</code> and
<code>//~ERROR</code> although the former is more common in the codebase).</p>
<h3 id="error-annotation-examples"><a class="header" href="#error-annotation-examples">Error annotation examples</a></h3>
<p>Here are examples of error annotations on different lines of UI test
source.</p>
<h4 id="positioned-on-error-line"><a class="header" href="#positioned-on-error-line">Positioned on error line</a></h4>
<p>Use the <code>//~ ERROR</code> idiom:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn main() {
    let x = (1, 2, 3);
    match x {
        (_a, _x @ ..) =&gt; {} //~ ERROR `_x @` is not allowed in a tuple
        _ =&gt; {}
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h4 id="positioned-below-error-line"><a class="header" href="#positioned-below-error-line">Positioned below error line</a></h4>
<p>Use the <code>//~^</code> idiom with number of carets in the string to indicate the
number of lines above.
In the example below, the error line is four lines above the error annotation
line so four carets are included in the annotation.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn main() {
    let x = (1, 2, 3);
    match x {
        (_a, _x @ ..) =&gt; {}  // &lt;- the error is on this line
        _ =&gt; {}
    }
}
//~^^^^ ERROR `_x @` is not allowed in a tuple
</code></pre>
<h4 id="use-same-error-line-as-defined-on-error-annotation-line-above"><a class="header" href="#use-same-error-line-as-defined-on-error-annotation-line-above">Use same error line as defined on error annotation line above</a></h4>
<p>Use the <code>//~|</code> idiom to define the same error line as the error annotation
line above:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">struct Binder(i32, i32, i32);

fn main() {
    let x = Binder(1, 2, 3);
    match x {
        Binder(_a, _x @ ..) =&gt; {}  // &lt;- the error is on this line
        _ =&gt; {}
    }
}
//~^^^^ ERROR `_x @` is not allowed in a tuple struct
//~| ERROR this pattern has 1 field, but the corresponding tuple struct has 3 fields [E0023]
</code></pre>
<h3 id="error-pattern"><a class="header" href="#error-pattern"><code>error-pattern</code></a></h3>
<p>The <code>error-pattern</code> <a href="tests/headers.html">header</a> can be used for
messages that don't have a specific span.</p>
<p>Let's think about this test:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn main() {
    let a: *const [_] = &amp;[1, 2, 3];
    unsafe {
        let _b = (*a)[3];
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>We want to ensure this shows &quot;index out of bounds&quot; but we cannot use the
<code>ERROR</code> annotation since the error doesn't have any span.
Then it's time to use the <code>error-pattern</code> header:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">// error-pattern: index out of bounds
fn main() {
    let a: *const [_] = &amp;[1, 2, 3];
    unsafe {
        let _b = (*a)[3];
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>But for strict testing, try to use the <code>ERROR</code> annotation as much as possible.</p>
<h3 id="error-levels"><a class="header" href="#error-levels">Error levels</a></h3>
<p>The error levels that you can have are:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>ERROR</code></li>
<li><code>WARN</code> or <code>WARNING</code></li>
<li><code>NOTE</code></li>
<li><code>HELP</code> and <code>SUGGESTION</code></li>
</ol>
<p>You are allowed to not include a level, but you should include it at least for
the primary message.</p>
<p>The <code>SUGGESTION</code> level is used for specifying what the expected replacement
text should be for a diagnostic suggestion.</p>
<p>UI tests use the <code>-A unused</code> flag by default to ignore all unused warnings, as
unused warnings are usually not the focus of a test.
However, simple code samples often have unused warnings.
If the test is specifically testing an unused warning, just add the
appropriate <code>#![warn(unused)]</code> attribute as needed.</p>
<h3 id="cfg-revisions"><a class="header" href="#cfg-revisions">cfg revisions</a></h3>
<p>When using <a href="tests/compiletest.html#revisions">revisions</a>, different messages can be
conditionally checked based on the current revision.
This is done by placing the revision cfg name in brackets like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">// edition:2018
// revisions: mir thir
// [thir]compile-flags: -Z thir-unsafeck

async unsafe fn f() {}

async fn g() {
    f(); //~ ERROR call to unsafe function is unsafe
}

fn main() {
    f(); //[mir]~ ERROR call to unsafe function is unsafe
}
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the second error message is only emitted in the <code>mir</code> revision.
The <code>thir</code> revision only emits the first error.</p>
<p>If the cfg causes the compiler to emit different output, then a test can have
multiple <code>.stderr</code> files for the different outputs.
In the example above, there would be a <code>.mir.stderr</code> and <code>.thir.stderr</code> file
with the different outputs of the different revisions.</p>
<h2 id="controlling-passfail-expectations"><a class="header" href="#controlling-passfail-expectations">Controlling pass/fail expectations</a></h2>
<p>By default, a UI test is expected to <strong>generate a compile error</strong> because most
of the tests are checking for invalid input and error diagnostics.
However, you can also make UI tests where compilation is expected to succeed,
and you can even run the resulting program.
Just add one of the following <a href="tests/headers.html">header commands</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pass headers:
<ul>
<li><code>// check-pass</code> — compilation should succeed but skip codegen
(which is expensive and isn't supposed to fail in most cases).</li>
<li><code>// build-pass</code> — compilation and linking should succeed but do
not run the resulting binary.</li>
<li><code>// run-pass</code> — compilation should succeed and running the resulting
binary should also succeed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fail headers:
<ul>
<li><code>// check-fail</code> — compilation should fail (the codegen phase is skipped).
This is the default for UI tests.</li>
<li><code>// build-fail</code> — compilation should fail during the codegen phase.
This will run <code>rustc</code> twice, once to verify that it compiles successfully
without the codegen phase, then a second time the full compile should
fail.</li>
<li><code>// run-fail</code> — compilation should succeed, but running the resulting
binary should fail.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For <code>run-pass</code> and <code>run-fail</code> tests, by default the output of the program
itself is not checked.
If you want to check the output of running the program, include the
<code>check-run-results</code> header.
This will check for a <code>.run.stderr</code> and <code>.run.stdout</code> files to compare
against the actual output of the program.</p>
<p>Tests with the <code>*-pass</code> headers can be overridden with the <code>--pass</code>
command-line option:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">./x.py test tests/ui --pass check
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>--pass</code> option only affects UI tests.
Using <code>--pass check</code> can run the UI test suite much faster (roughly twice as
fast on my system), though obviously not exercising as much.</p>
<p>The <code>ignore-pass</code> header can be used to ignore the <code>--pass</code> CLI flag if the
test won't work properly with that override.</p>
<h2 id="known-bugs"><a class="header" href="#known-bugs">Known bugs</a></h2>
<p>The <code>known-bug</code> header may be used for tests that demonstrate a known bug that
has not yet been fixed.
Adding tests for known bugs is helpful for several reasons, including:</p>
<ol>
<li>Maintaining a functional test that can be conveniently reused when the bug is fixed.</li>
<li>Providing a sentinel that will fail if the bug is incidentally fixed.
This can alert the developer so they know that the associated issue has
been fixed and can possibly be closed.</li>
</ol>
<p>Do not include <a href="tests/ui.html#error-annotations">error annotations</a> in a test with <code>known-bug</code>.
The test should still include other normal headers and stdout/stderr files.</p>
<h2 id="test-organization"><a class="header" href="#test-organization">Test organization</a></h2>
<p>When deciding where to place a test file, please try to find a subdirectory
that best matches what you are trying to exercise.
Do your best to keep things organized.
Admittedly it can be difficult as some tests can overlap different categories,
and the existing layout may not fit well.</p>
<p>For regression tests – basically, some random snippet of code that came in
from the internet – we often name the test after the issue plus a short
description.
Ideally, the test should be added to a directory that helps identify what
piece of code is being tested here (e.g.,
<code>tests/ui/borrowck/issue-54597-reject-move-out-of-borrow-via-pat.rs</code>)</p>
<p>When writing a new feature, <strong>create a subdirectory to store your tests</strong>.
For example, if you are implementing RFC 1234 (&quot;Widgets&quot;), then it might make
sense to put the tests in a directory like <code>tests/ui/rfc1234-widgets/</code>.</p>
<p>In other cases, there may already be a suitable directory. (The proper
directory structure to use is actually an area of active debate.)</p>
<p>Over time, the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/tests/ui"><code>tests/ui</code></a> directory has grown very fast.
There is a check in <a href="tests/intro.html#tidy">tidy</a> that will ensure none of the
subdirectories has more than 1000 entries.
Having too many files causes problems because it isn't editor/IDE friendly and
the GitHub UI won't show more than 1000 entries.
However, since <code>tests/ui</code> (UI test root directory) and <code>tests/ui/issues</code>
directories have more than 1000 entries, we set a different limit for those
directories.
So, please avoid putting a new test there and try to find a more relevant
place.</p>
<p>For example, if your test is related to closures, you should put it in
<code>tests/ui/closures</code>.
If you're not sure where is the best place, it's still okay to add to
<code>tests/ui/issues/</code>.
When you reach the limit, you could increase it by tweaking <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/tools/tidy/src/ui_tests.rs">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="rustfix-tests"><a class="header" href="#rustfix-tests">Rustfix tests</a></h2>
<p>UI tests can validate that diagnostic suggestions apply correctly
and that the resulting changes compile correctly.
This can be done with the <code>run-rustfix</code> header:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">// run-rustfix
// check-pass
#![crate_type = &quot;lib&quot;]

pub struct not_camel_case {}
//~^ WARN `not_camel_case` should have an upper camel case name
//~| HELP convert the identifier to upper camel case
//~| SUGGESTION NotCamelCase
</code></pre>
<p>Rustfix tests should have a file with the <code>.fixed</code> extension which contains
the source file after the suggestion has been applied.</p>
<p>When the test is run, compiletest first checks that the correct
lint/warning is generated.
Then, it applies the suggestion and compares against <code>.fixed</code> (they must match).
Finally, the fixed source is compiled, and this compilation is required to succeed.</p>
<p>Usually when creating a rustfix test you will generate the <code>.fixed</code> file
automatically with the <code>x.py test --bless</code> option.</p>
<p>The <code>run-rustfix</code> header will cause <em>all</em> suggestions to be applied, even
if they are not <a href="tests/../diagnostics.html#suggestions"><code>MachineApplicable</code></a>.
If this is a problem, then you can instead use the <code>rustfix-only-machine-applicable</code>
header.
This should be used if there is a mixture of different suggestion levels, and
some of the non-machine-applicable ones do not apply cleanly.</p>
<h2 id="compare-modes-1"><a class="header" href="#compare-modes-1">Compare modes</a></h2>
<p><a href="tests/compiletest.html#compare-modes">Compare modes</a> can be used to run all tests
with different flags from what they are normally compiled with.
In some cases, this might result in different output from the compiler.
To support this, different output files can be saved which contain the
output based on the compare mode.</p>
<p>For example, when using the Polonius mode, a test <code>foo.rs</code> will
first look for expected output in <code>foo.polonius.stderr</code>, falling back to the usual
<code>foo.stderr</code> if not found.
This is useful as different modes can sometimes result in different
diagnostics and behavior.
This can help track which tests have differences between the modes, and to
visually inspect those diagnostic differences.</p>
<p>If in the rare case you encounter a test that has different behavior, you can
run something like the following to generate the alternate stderr file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">./x.py test tests/ui --compare-mode=polonius --bless
</code></pre>
<p>Currently none of the compare modes are checked in CI for UI tests.</p>

<p>Header commands are special comments that tell compiletest how to build and
interpret a test.
They must appear before the Rust source in the test.
They may also appear in Makefiles for <a href="tests/compiletest.html#run-make-tests">run-make tests</a>.</p>
<p>They are normally put after the short comment that explains the point of this test.
For example, this test uses the <code>// compile-flags</code> command to specify a custom
flag to give to rustc when the test is compiled:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">// Test the behavior of `0 - 1` when overflow checks are disabled.

// compile-flags: -C overflow-checks=off

fn main() {
    let x = 0 - 1;

<li><code>ignore-llvm-version: 7.0 - 9.9.9</code> — ignores LLVM versions in a range (inclusive)</li>
<li><code>needs-llvm-components: powerpc</code> — ignores if the specific LLVM component was not built.
Note: The test will fail on CI if the component does not exist.</li>
<li><code>needs-matching-clang</code> — ignores if the version of clang does not match the

e.g. <code>compile-flags -g</code> which forces debuginfo to be enabled.</li>
<li><code>run-flags</code> passes extra args to the test if the test is to be executed.</li>
<li><code>edition</code> controls the edition the test should be compiled with
(defaults to 2015). Example usage: <code>// edition:2018</code>.</li>
<li><code>failure-status</code> specifies the numeric exit code that should be expected for
tests that expect an error.
If this is not set, the default is 1.</li>
<li><code>should-fail</code> indicates that the test should fail; used for &quot;meta
testing&quot;, where we test the compiletest program itself to check that
it will generate errors in appropriate scenarios. This header is
ignored for pretty-printer tests.</li>
<li><code>gate-test-X</code> where <code>X</code> is a feature marks the test as &quot;gate test&quot;
for feature X.
Such tests are supposed to ensure that the compiler errors when usage of a
gated feature is attempted without the proper <code>#![feature(X)]</code> tag.
Each unstable lang feature is required to have a gate test.
This header is actually checked by <a href="tests/intro.html#tidy">tidy</a>, it is not checked
by compiletest.</li>
<li><code>error-pattern</code> checks the diagnostics just like the <code>ERROR</code> annotation
without specifying error line. This is useful when the error doesn't give
any span. See <a href="tests/ui.html#error-pattern"><code>error-pattern</code></a>.</li>
<li><code>incremental</code> runs the test with the <code>-C incremental</code> flag and an empty
incremental directory. This should be avoided when possible; you should use
an <em>incremental mode</em> test instead. Incremental mode tests support running
the compiler multiple times and verifying that it can load the generated
incremental cache. This flag is for specialized circumstances, like checking
the interaction of codegen unit partitioning with generating an incremental
cache.</li>
<li><code>no-prefer-dynamic</code> will force an auxiliary crate to be built as an rlib
instead of a dylib. When specified in a test, it will remove the use of <code>-C prefer-dynamic</code>. This can be useful in a variety of circumstances. For
example, it can prevent a proc-macro from being built with the wrong crate
type. Or if your test is specifically targeting behavior of other crate
types, it can be used to prevent building with the wrong crate type.</li>
<li><code>force-host</code> will force the test to build for the host platform instead of
the target. This is useful primarily for auxiliary proc-macros, which need
to be loaded by the host compiler.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="substitutions"><a class="header" href="#substitutions">Substitutions</a></h2>
<p>Headers values support substituting a few variables which will be replaced
with their corresponding value.
For example, if you need to pass a compiler flag with a path to a specific
file, something like the following could work:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">// compile-flags: --remap-path-prefix={{src-base}}=/the/src
</code></pre>
<p>Where the sentinel <code>{{src-base}}</code> will be replaced with the appropriate path
described below:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>{{cwd}}</code>: The directory where compiletest is run from. This may not be the
root of the checkout, so you should avoid using it where possible.
<ul>
<li>Examples: <code>/path/to/rust</code>, <code>/path/to/build/root</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>{{src-base}}</code>: The directory where the test is defined. This is equivalent to
<code>$DIR</code> for <a href="tests/ui.html#normalization">output normalization</a>.
<ul>
<li>Example: <code>/path/to/rust/tests/ui/error-codes</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>{{build-base}}</code>: The base directory where the test's output goes. This is
equivalent to <code>$TEST_BUILD_DIR</code> for <a href="tests/ui.html#normalization">output normalization</a>.
<ul>
<li>Example: <code>/path/to/rust/build/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/test/ui</code></li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p>See <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/tests/ui/commandline-argfile.rs"><code>tests/ui/commandline-argfile.rs</code></a>
for an example of a test that uses this substitution.</p>
<h2 id="adding-a-new-header-command"><a class="header" href="#adding-a-new-header-command">Adding a new header command</a></h2>
<p>One would add a new header command if there is a need to define some test
property or behavior on an individual, test-by-test basis.
A header command property serves as the header command's backing store (holds
the command's current value) at runtime.</p>
<p>To add a new header command property:</p>
<ol>
<li>Look for the <code>pub struct TestProps</code> declaration in
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/tools/compiletest/src/header.rs"><code>src/tools/compiletest/src/header.rs</code></a> and add the new public property to
the end of the declaration.</li>
<li>Look for the <code>impl TestProps</code> implementation block immediately following
the struct declaration and initialize the new property to its default
value.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="adding-a-new-header-command-parser"><a class="header" href="#adding-a-new-header-command-parser">Adding a new header command parser</a></h3>
<p>When <code>compiletest</code> encounters a test file, it parses the file a line at a time
by calling every parser defined in the <code>Config</code> struct's implementation block,
also in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/tools/compiletest/src/header.rs"><code>src/tools/compiletest/src/header.rs</code></a> (note that the <code>Config</code>
struct's declaration block is found in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/tools/compiletest/src/common.rs"><code>src/tools/compiletest/src/common.rs</code></a>).
<code>TestProps</code>'s <code>load_from()</code> method will try passing the current line of text to
each parser, which, in turn typically checks to see if the line begins with a
particular commented (<code>//</code>) header command such as <code>// must-compile-successfully</code>
or <code>// failure-status</code>. Whitespace after the comment marker is optional.</p>
<p>Parsers will override a given header command property's default value merely by
being specified in the test file as a header command or by having a parameter
value specified in the test file, depending on the header command.</p>
<p>Parsers defined in <code>impl Config</code> are typically named <code>parse_&lt;header_command&gt;</code>
(note kebab-case <code>&lt;header-command&gt;</code> transformed to snake-case
<code>&lt;header_command&gt;</code>). <code>impl Config</code> also defines several 'low-level' parsers
which make it simple to parse common patterns like simple presence or not
(<code>parse_name_directive()</code>), header-command:parameter(s)
(<code>parse_name_value_directive()</code>), optional parsing only if a particular <code>cfg</code>
attribute is defined (<code>has_cfg_prefix()</code>) and many more. The low-level parsers
are found near the end of the <code>impl Config</code> block; be sure to look through them
and their associated parsers immediately above to see how they are used to
avoid writing additional parsing code unnecessarily.</p>
<p>As a concrete example, here is the implementation for the
<code>parse_failure_status()</code> parser, in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/tools/compiletest/src/header.rs"><code>src/tools/compiletest/src/header.rs</code></a>:</p>

<p>When a test invokes a particular header command, it is expected that some
behavior will change as a result. What behavior, obviously, will depend on the
purpose of the header command. In the case of <code>failure-status</code>, the behavior
that changes is that <code>compiletest</code> expects the failure code defined by the

<p>A lot of work is put into improving the performance of the compiler and
preventing performance regressions.
The <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf">rustc-perf</a> project provides
several services for testing and tracking performance.
It provides hosted infrastructure for running benchmarks as a service.
At this time, only <code>x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu</code> builds are tracked.</p>
<p>A &quot;perf run&quot; is used to compare the performance of the compiler in different
configurations for a large collection of popular crates.
Different configurations include &quot;fresh builds&quot;, builds with incremental compilation, etc.</p>
<p>The result of a perf run is a comparison between two versions of the compiler
(by their commit hashes).</p>
<h3 id="automatic-perf-runs"><a class="header" href="#automatic-perf-runs">Automatic perf runs</a></h3>
<p>After every PR is merged, a suite of benchmarks are run against the compiler.
The results are tracked over time on the <a href="https://perf.rust-lang.org/">https://perf.rust-lang.org/</a> website.
Any changes are noted in a comment on the PR.</p>
<h3 id="manual-perf-runs"><a class="header" href="#manual-perf-runs">Manual perf runs</a></h3>
<p>Additionally, performance tests can be ran before a PR is merged on an as-needed basis.
You should request a perf run if your PR may affect performance, especially if
it can affect performance adversely.</p>
<p>To evaluate the performance impact of a PR, write this comment on the PR:</p>
<p><code>@bors try @rust-timer queue</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Only users authorized to do perf runs are allowed to post this comment.
Teams that are allowed to use it are tracked in the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/team">Teams
repository</a> with the <code>perf = true</code> value
in the <code>[permissions]</code> section (and bors permissions are also required).
If you are not on one of those teams, feel free to ask for someone to post
it for you (either on Zulip or ask the assigned reviewer).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This will first tell bors to do a &quot;try&quot; build which do a full release build
for <code>x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu</code>.
After the build finishes, it will place it in the queue to run the performance
suite against it.
After the performance tests finish, the bot will post a comment on the PR with
a summary and a link to a full report.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/crater">Crater</a> is a tool for compiling
and running tests for <em>every</em> crate on <a href="https://crates.io">crates.io</a> (and a
few on GitHub). It is mainly used for checking the extent of breakage when
implementing potentially breaking changes and ensuring lack of breakage by
running beta vs stable compiler versions.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-run-crater"><a class="header" href="#when-to-run-crater">When to run Crater</a></h2>
<p>You should request a crater run if your PR makes large changes to the compiler
or could cause breakage. If you are unsure, feel free to ask your PR's reviewer.</p>
<h2 id="requesting-crater-runs"><a class="header" href="#requesting-crater-runs">Requesting Crater Runs</a></h2>
<p>The rust team maintains a few machines that can be used for running crater runs
on the changes introduced by a PR. If your PR needs a crater run, leave a
comment for the triage team in the PR thread. Please inform the team whether
you require a &quot;check-only&quot; crater run, a &quot;build only&quot; crater run, or a
&quot;build-and-test&quot; crater run. The difference is primarily in time; the
conservative (if you're not sure) option is to go for the build-and-test run.
If making changes that will only have an effect at compile-time (e.g.,
implementing a new trait) then you only need a check run.</p>
<p>Your PR will be enqueued by the triage team and the results will be posted when
they are ready. Check runs will take around ~3-4 days, with the other two
taking 5-6 days on average.</p>
<p>While crater is really useful, it is also important to be aware of a few
caveats:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Not all code is on crates.io! There is a lot of code in repos on GitHub and
elsewhere. Also, companies may not wish to publish their code. Thus, a
successful crater run is not a magically green light that there will be no
breakage; you still need to be careful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Crater only runs Linux builds on x86_64. Thus, other architectures and
platforms are not tested. Critically, this includes Windows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many crates are not tested. This could be for a lot of reasons, including
that the crate doesn't compile any more (e.g. used old nightly features),
has broken or flaky tests, requires network access, or other reasons.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before crater can be run, <code>@bors try</code> needs to succeed in building artifacts.
This means that if your code doesn't compile, you cannot run crater.</p>

<p>This chapter contains a few tips to debug the compiler. These tips aim to be
useful no matter what you are working on.  Some of the other chapters have
advice about specific parts of the compiler (e.g. the <a href="./incrcomp-debugging.html">Queries Debugging and
Testing chapter</a> or the <a href="./backend/debugging.html">LLVM Debugging
chapter</a>).</p>
<h2 id="configuring-the-compiler-1"><a class="header" href="#configuring-the-compiler-1">Configuring the compiler</a></h2>
<p>By default, rustc is built without most debug information. To enable debug info,
set <code>debug = true</code> in your config.toml.</p>
<p>Setting <code>debug = true</code> turns on many different debug options (e.g., <code>debug-assertions</code>,
<code>debug-logging</code>, etc.) which can be individually tweaked if you want to, but many people
simply set <code>debug = true</code>.</p>
<p>If you want to use GDB to debug rustc, please set <code>config.toml</code> with options:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[rust]
debug = true
debuginfo-level = 2
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE:
This will use a lot of disk space
(upwards of <!-- date-check Aug 2022 --> 35GB),
and will take a lot more compile time.
With <code>debuginfo-level = 1</code> (the default when <code>debug = true</code>),
you will be able to track the execution path,
but will lose the symbol information for debugging.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The default configuration will enable <code>symbol-mangling-version</code> v0.
This requires at least GDB v10.2,
otherwise you need to disable new symbol-mangling-version in <code>config.toml</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[rust]
new-symbol-mangling = false
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>See the comments in <code>config.toml.example</code> for more info.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You will need to rebuild the compiler after changing any configuration option.</p>
<h2 id="-z-flags"><a class="header" href="#-z-flags"><code>-Z</code> flags</a></h2>
<p>The compiler has a bunch of <code>-Z</code> flags. These are unstable flags that are only
enabled on nightly. Many of them are useful for debugging. To get a full listing
of <code>-Z</code> flags, use <code>-Z help</code>.</p>
<p>One useful flag is <code>-Z verbose</code>, which generally enables printing more info that
could be useful for debugging.</p>
<h2 id="getting-a-backtrace"><a class="header" href="#getting-a-backtrace">Getting a backtrace</a></h2>
<p>When you have an ICE (panic in the compiler), you can set
<code>RUST_BACKTRACE=1</code> to get the stack trace of the <code>panic!</code> like in
normal Rust programs. IIRC backtraces <strong>don't work</strong> on MinGW,
sorry. If you have trouble or the backtraces are full of <code>unknown</code>,
you might want to find some way to use Linux, Mac, or MSVC on Windows.</p>
<p>In the default configuration (without <code>debug</code> set to <code>true</code>), you don't have line numbers
enabled, so the backtrace looks like this:</p>

<p>If you want to get a backtrace to the point where the compiler emits an
error message, you can pass the <code>-Z treat-err-as-bug=n</code>, which will make
the compiler panic on the <code>nth</code> error on <code>delay_span_bug</code>. If you leave
off <code>=n</code>, the compiler will assume <code>1</code> for <code>n</code> and thus panic on the
first error it encounters.</p>

dumps various borrow-checker dataflow graphs.</p>
<p>These all produce <code>.dot</code> files. To view these files, install graphviz (e.g.
<code>apt-get install graphviz</code>) and then run the following commands:</p>

uses HTML to highlight code regions in the original source code and display
compiler metadata associated with each region.
<a href="./mir/debugging.html"><code>-Z dump-mir-spanview</code></a>, for example, highlights spans
associated with each MIR <code>Statement</code>, <code>Terminator</code>, and/or <code>BasicBlock</code>.</p>
<p>These <code>.html</code> files use CSS features to dynamically expand spans obscured by
overlapping spans, and native tooltips (based on the HTML <code>title</code> attribute) to
reveal the actual MIR elements, as text.</p>
<p>To view these files, simply use a modern browser, or a CSS-capable HTML preview

<li><a href="tracing.html#logging-etiquette-and-conventions">Logging etiquette and conventions</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The compiler has a lot of <a href="https://docs.rs/tracing/0.1/tracing/macro.debug.html"><code>debug!</code></a> (or <code>trace!</code>) calls, which print out logging information
at many points. These are very useful to at least narrow down the location of
a bug if not to find it entirely, or just to orient yourself as to why the
compiler is doing a particular thing.</p>
<p>To see the logs, you need to set the <code>RUSTC_LOG</code> environment variable to your
log filter. The full syntax of the log filters can be found in the <a href="https://docs.rs/tracing-subscriber/0.2.24/tracing_subscriber/filter/struct.EnvFilter.html#directives">rustdoc
of <code>tracing-subscriber</code></a>.</p>
<h2 id="function-level-filters"><a class="header" href="#function-level-filters">Function level filters</a></h2>
<p>Lots of functions in rustc are annotated with</p>
<pre><code>#[instrument(level = &quot;debug&quot;, skip(self))]
fn foo(&amp;self, bar: Type) {}
</code></pre>
<p>which allows you to use</p>
<pre><code>RUSTC_LOG=[foo]
</code></pre>
<p>to do the following all at once</p>
<ul>
<li>log all function calls to <code>foo</code></li>
<li>log the arguments (except for those in the <code>skip</code> list)</li>
<li>log everything (from anywhere else in the compiler) until the function returns</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="i-dont-want-everything"><a class="header" href="#i-dont-want-everything">I don't want everything</a></h3>
<p>Depending on the scope of the function, you may not want to log everything in its body.
As an example: the <code>do_mir_borrowck</code> function will dump hundreds of lines even for trivial
code being borrowchecked.</p>
<p>Since you can combine all filters, you can add a crate/module path, e.g.</p>
<pre><code>RUSTC_LOG=rustc_borrowck[do_mir_borrowck]
</code></pre>
<h3 id="i-dont-want-all-calls"><a class="header" href="#i-dont-want-all-calls">I don't want all calls</a></h3>
<p>If you are compiling libcore, you likely don't want <em>all</em> borrowck dumps, but only one
for a specific function. You can filter function calls by their arguments by regexing them.</p>
<pre><code>RUSTC_LOG=[do_mir_borrowck{id=\.\*from_utf8_unchecked\.\*}]
</code></pre>
<p>will only give you the logs of borrowchecking <code>from_utf8_unchecked</code>. Note that you will
still get a short message per ignored <code>do_mir_borrowck</code>, but none of the things inside those
calls. This helps you in looking through the calls that are happening and helps you adjust
your regex if you mistyped it.</p>
<h2 id="query-level-filters"><a class="header" href="#query-level-filters">Query level filters</a></h2>
<p>Every <a href="query.html">query</a> is automatically tagged with a logging span so that
you can display all log messages during the execution of the query. For
example, if you want to log everything during type checking:</p>
<pre><code>RUSTC_LOG=[typeck]
</code></pre>
<p>The query arguments are included as a tracing field which means that you can
filter on the debug display of the arguments. For example, the <code>typeck</code> query
has an argument <code>key: LocalDefId</code> of what is being checked. You can use a
regex to match on that <code>LocalDefId</code> to log type checking for a specific
function:</p>
<pre><code>RUSTC_LOG=[typeck{key=.*name_of_item.*}]
</code></pre>
<p>Different queries have different arguments. You can find a list of queries and
their arguments in
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/compiler/rustc_middle/src/query/mod.rs#L18"><code>rustc_middle/src/query/mod.rs</code></a>.</p>
<h2 id="broad-module-level-filters"><a class="header" href="#broad-module-level-filters">Broad module level filters</a></h2>
<p>You can also use filters similar to the <code>log</code> crate's filters, which will enable
everything within a specific module. This is often too verbose and too unstructured,
so it is recommended to use function level filters.</p>
<p>Your log filter can be just <code>debug</code> to get all <code>debug!</code> output and
higher (e.g., it will also include <code>info!</code>), or <code>path::to::module</code> to get <em>all</em>
output (which will include <code>trace!</code>) from a particular module, or
<code>path::to::module=debug</code> to get <code>debug!</code> output and higher from a particular
module.</p>
<p>For example, to get the <code>debug!</code> output and higher for a specific module, you
can run the compiler with <code>RUSTC_LOG=path::to::module=debug rustc my-file.rs</code>.
All <code>debug!</code> output will then appear in standard error.</p>
<p>Note that you can use a partial path and the filter will still work. For
example, if you want to see <code>info!</code> output from only
<code>rustdoc::passes::collect_intra_doc_links</code>, you could use
<code>RUSTDOC_LOG=rustdoc::passes::collect_intra_doc_links=info</code> <em>or</em> you could use
<code>RUSTDOC_LOG=rustdoc::passes::collect_intra=info</code>.</p>
<p>If you are developing rustdoc, use <code>RUSTDOC_LOG</code> instead. If you are developing
Miri, use <code>MIRI_LOG</code> instead. You get the idea :)</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://docs.rs/tracing"><code>tracing</code></a> crate's docs, and specifically the docs for <a href="https://docs.rs/tracing/0.1/tracing/macro.debug.html"><code>debug!</code></a> to
see the full syntax you can use. (Note: unlike the compiler, the <a href="https://docs.rs/tracing"><code>tracing</code></a>
crate and its examples use the <code>RUST_LOG</code> environment variable. rustc, rustdoc,
and other tools set custom environment variables.)</p>
<p><strong>Note that unless you use a very strict filter, the logger will emit a lot of
output, so use the most specific module(s) you can (comma-separated if
multiple)</strong>. It's typically a good idea to pipe standard error to a file and
look at the log output with a text editor.</p>
<p>So, to put it together:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># This puts the output of all debug calls in `rustc_middle/src/traits` into
# standard error, which might fill your console backscroll.
$ RUSTC_LOG=rustc_middle::traits=debug rustc +stage1 my-file.rs

# This puts the output of all debug calls in `rustc_middle/src/traits` in
# `traits-log`, so you can then see it with a text editor.
$ RUSTC_LOG=rustc_middle::traits=debug rustc +stage1 my-file.rs 2&gt;traits-log

# Not recommended! This will show the output of all `debug!` calls
# in the Rust compiler, and there are a *lot* of them, so it will be
# hard to find anything.
$ RUSTC_LOG=debug rustc +stage1 my-file.rs 2&gt;all-log

# This will show the output of all `info!` calls in `rustc_codegen_ssa`.
#
# There's an `info!` statement in `codegen_instance` that outputs
# every function that is codegen'd. This is useful to find out
# which function triggers an LLVM assertion, and this is an `info!`
# log rather than a `debug!` log so it will work on the official
# compilers.
$ RUSTC_LOG=rustc_codegen_ssa=info rustc +stage1 my-file.rs

# This will show the output of all `info!` calls made by rustdoc
# or any rustc library it calls.
$ RUSTDOC_LOG=info rustdoc +stage1 my-file.rs

# This will only show `debug!` calls made by rustdoc directly,
# not any `rustc*` crate.
$ RUSTDOC_LOG=rustdoc=debug rustdoc +stage1 my-file.rs
</code></pre>
<h2 id="log-colors"><a class="header" href="#log-colors">Log colors</a></h2>
<p>By default, rustc (and other tools, like rustdoc and Miri) will be smart about
when to use ANSI colors in the log output. If they are outputting to a terminal,
they will use colors, and if they are outputting to a file or being piped
somewhere else, they will not. However, it's hard to read log output in your
terminal unless you have a very strict filter, so you may want to pipe the
output to a pager like <code>less</code>. But then there won't be any colors, which makes
it hard to pick out what you're looking for!</p>
<p>You can override whether to have colors in log output with the <code>RUSTC_LOG_COLOR</code>
environment variable (or <code>RUSTDOC_LOG_COLOR</code> for rustdoc, or <code>MIRI_LOG_COLOR</code>
for Miri, etc.). There are three options: <code>auto</code> (the default), <code>always</code>, and
<code>never</code>. So, if you want to enable colors when piping to <code>less</code>, use something
similar to this command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># The `-R` switch tells less to print ANSI colors without escaping them.
$ RUSTC_LOG=debug RUSTC_LOG_COLOR=always rustc +stage1 ... | less -R
</code></pre>
<p>Note that <code>MIRI_LOG_COLOR</code> will only color logs that come from Miri, not logs
from rustc functions that Miri calls. Use <code>RUSTC_LOG_COLOR</code> to color logs from
rustc.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-keep-or-remove-debug-and-trace-calls-from-the-resulting-binary"><a class="header" href="#how-to-keep-or-remove-debug-and-trace-calls-from-the-resulting-binary">How to keep or remove <code>debug!</code> and <code>trace!</code> calls from the resulting binary</a></h2>
<p>While calls to <code>error!</code>, <code>warn!</code> and <code>info!</code> are included in every build of the compiler,
calls to <code>debug!</code> and <code>trace!</code> are only included in the program if
<code>debug-logging=true</code> is turned on in config.toml (it is
turned off by default), so if you don't see <code>DEBUG</code> logs, especially
if you run the compiler with <code>RUSTC_LOG=rustc rustc some.rs</code> and only see
<code>INFO</code> logs, make sure that <code>debug-logging=true</code> is turned on in your
config.toml.</p>
<h2 id="logging-etiquette-and-conventions"><a class="header" href="#logging-etiquette-and-conventions">Logging etiquette and conventions</a></h2>
<p>Because calls to <code>debug!</code> are removed by default, in most cases, don't worry
about the performance of adding &quot;unnecessary&quot; calls to <code>debug!</code> and leaving them in code you
commit - they won't slow down the performance of what we ship.</p>
<p>That said, there can also be excessive tracing calls, especially
when they are redundant with other calls nearby or in functions called from
here. There is no perfect balance to hit here, and is left to the reviewer's
discretion to decide whether to let you leave <code>debug!</code> statements in or whether to ask
you to remove them before merging.</p>
<p>It may be preferable to use <code>trace!</code> over <code>debug!</code> for very noisy logs.</p>
<p>A loosely followed convention is to use <code>#[instrument(level = &quot;debug&quot;)]</code>
(<a href="https://docs.rs/tracing-attributes/0.1.17/tracing_attributes/attr.instrument.html">also see the attribute's documentation</a>)
in favour of <code>debug!(&quot;foo(...)&quot;)</code> at the start of a function <code>foo</code>.
Within functions, prefer <code>debug!(?variable.field)</code> over <code>debug!(&quot;xyz = {:?}&quot;, variable.field)</code>
and <code>debug!(bar = ?var.method(arg))</code> over <code>debug!(&quot;bar = {:?}&quot;, var.method(arg))</code>.
The documentation for this syntax can be found <a href="https://docs.rs/tracing/0.1.28/tracing/#recording-fields">here</a>.</p>
<p>One thing to be <strong>careful</strong> of is <strong>expensive</strong> operations in logs.</p>
<p>If in the module <code>rustc::foo</code> you have a statement</p>
<pre><code class="language-Rust">debug!(x = ?random_operation(tcx));
</code></pre>
<p>Then if someone runs a debug <code>rustc</code> with <code>RUSTC_LOG=rustc::foo</code>, then
<code>random_operation()</code> will run. <code>RUSTC_LOG</code> filters that do not enable this
debug statement will not execute <code>random_operation</code>.</p>
<p>This means that you should not put anything too expensive or likely to crash
there - that would annoy anyone who wants to use logging for that module.
No-one will know it until someone tries to use logging to find <em>another</em> bug.</p>

<p>This section talks about how to profile the compiler and find out where it spends its time.</p>
<p>Depending on what you're trying to measure, there are several different approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you want to see if a PR improves or regresses compiler performance,
see the <a href="tests/perf.html">rustc-perf chapter</a> for requesting a benchmarking run.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want a medium-to-high level overview of where <code>rustc</code> is spending its time:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>-Z self-profile</code> flag and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/measureme">measureme</a> tools offer a query-based approach to profiling.
See <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/measureme/blob/master/summarize/README.md">their docs</a> for more information.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want function level performance data or even just more details than the above approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider using a native code profiler such as <a href="profiling/with_perf.html">perf</a></li>
<li>or <a href="https://github.com/nagisa/rust_tracy_client">tracy</a> for a nanosecond-precision,
full-featured graphical interface.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want a nice visual representation of the compile times of your crate graph,
you can use <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/cargo/reference/timings.html">cargo's <code>--timings</code> flag</a>,
e.g. <code>cargo build --timings</code>.
You can use this flag on the compiler itself with <code>CARGOFLAGS=&quot;--timings&quot; ./x.py build</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to profile memory usage, you can use various tools depending on what operating system

<p>Using <a href="https://github.com/dtolnay/cargo-llvm-lines">cargo-llvm-lines</a> you can count the
number of lines of LLVM IR across all instantiations of a generic function.
Since most of the time compiling rustc is spent in LLVM, the idea is that by
reducing the amount of code passed to LLVM, compiling rustc gets faster.</p>
<p>To use <code>cargo-llvm-lines</code> together with somewhat custom rustc build process, you can use
<code>-C save-temps</code> to obtain required LLVM IR. The option preserves temporary work products
created during compilation. Among those is LLVM IR that represents an input to the
optimization pipeline; ideal for our purposes. It is stored in files with <code>*.no-opt.bc</code>
extension in LLVM bitcode format.</p>
<p>Example usage:</p>
<pre><code>cargo install cargo-llvm-lines
# On a normal crate you could now run `cargo llvm-lines`, but `x.py` isn't normal :P

# Do a clean before every run, to not mix in the results from previous runs.
./x.py clean
env RUSTFLAGS=-Csave-temps ./x.py build --stage 0 compiler/rustc

# Single crate, e.g., rustc_middle. (Relies on the glob support of your shell.)
# Convert unoptimized LLVM bitcode into a human readable LLVM assembly accepted by cargo-llvm-lines.

<p>Since this doesn't seem to work with incremental compilation or <code>./x.py check</code>,
you will be compiling rustc <em>a lot</em>.
I recommend changing a few settings in <code>config.toml</code> to make it bearable:</p>
<pre><code>[rust]
# A debug build takes _a third_ as long on my machine,
# but compiling more than stage0 rustc becomes unbearably slow.
optimize = false

# We can't use incremental anyway, so we disable it for a little speed boost.
incremental = false
# We won't be running it, so no point in compiling debug checks.
debug = false

# Using a single codegen unit gives less output, but is slower to compile.
codegen-units = 0  # num_cpus
</code></pre>
<p>The llvm-lines output is affected by several options.
<code>optimize = false</code> increases it from 2.1GB to 3.5GB and <code>codegen-units = 0</code> to 4.1GB.</p>
<p>MIR optimizations have little impact. Compared to the default <code>RUSTFLAGS=&quot;-Z mir-opt-level=1&quot;</code>, level 0 adds 0.3GB and level 2 removes 0.2GB.
As of <!-- date-check --> July 2022,
inlining happens in LLVM and GCC codegen backends,
missing only in the Cranelift one.</p>

<h2 id="initial-steps"><a class="header" href="#initial-steps">Initial steps</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Get a clean checkout of rust-lang/master, or whatever it is you want

<li>Set the following settings in your <code>config.toml</code>:
<ul>
<li><code>debuginfo-level = 1</code> - enables line debuginfo</li>

<h2 id="gathering-a-perf-profile"><a class="header" href="#gathering-a-perf-profile">Gathering a perf profile</a></h2>
<p>perf is an excellent tool on linux that can be used to gather and
analyze all kinds of information. Mostly it is used to figure out
where a program spends its time. It can also be used for other sorts
of events, though, like cache misses and so forth.</p>
<h3 id="the-basics"><a class="header" href="#the-basics">The basics</a></h3>
<p>The basic <code>perf</code> command is this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">perf record -F99 --call-graph dwarf XXX
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>-F99</code> tells perf to sample at 99 Hz, which avoids generating too
much data for longer runs (why 99 Hz you ask? It is often chosen
because it is unlikely to be in lockstep with other periodic
activity). The <code>--call-graph dwarf</code> tells perf to get call-graph
information from debuginfo, which is accurate. The <code>XXX</code> is the
command you want to profile. So, for example, you might do:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">perf record -F99 --call-graph dwarf cargo +&lt;toolchain&gt; rustc
</code></pre>
<p>to run <code>cargo</code> -- here <code>&lt;toolchain&gt;</code> should be the name of the toolchain
you made in the beginning. But there are some things to be aware of:</p>
<ul>
<li>You probably don't want to profile the time spend building
dependencies. So something like <code>cargo build; cargo clean -p $C</code> may
be helpful (where <code>$C</code> is the crate name)
<ul>
<li>Though usually I just do <code>touch src/lib.rs</code> and rebuild instead. =)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You probably don't want incremental messing about with your
profile. So something like <code>CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0</code> can be helpful.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="gathering-a-perf-profile-from-a-perfrust-langorg-test"><a class="header" href="#gathering-a-perf-profile-from-a-perfrust-langorg-test">Gathering a perf profile from a <code>perf.rust-lang.org</code> test</a></h3>
<p>Often we want to analyze a specific test from <code>perf.rust-lang.org</code>. To
do that, the first step is to clone
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf">the rustc-perf repository</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">git clone https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf
</code></pre>
<h4 id="doing-it-the-easy-way"><a class="header" href="#doing-it-the-easy-way">Doing it the easy way</a></h4>
<p>Once you've cloned the repo, you can use the <code>collector</code> executable to
do profiling for you! You can find
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/blob/master/collector/README.md#profiling">instructions in the rustc-perf readme</a>.</p>
<p>For example, to measure the clap-rs test, you might do:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">./target/release/collector                                      \
  --output-repo /path/to/place/output                           \
  profile perf-record                                           \
  --rustc /path/to/rustc/executable/from/your/build/directory   \
  --cargo `which cargo`                                         \
  --filter clap-rs                                              \
  --builds Check                                                \
</code></pre>
<p>You can also use that same command to use cachegrind or other profiling tools.</p>
<h4 id="doing-it-the-hard-way"><a class="header" href="#doing-it-the-hard-way">Doing it the hard way</a></h4>
<p>If you prefer to run things manually, that is also possible. You first
need to find the source for the test you want. Sources for the tests
are found in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-perf/tree/master/collector/benchmarks">the <code>collector/benchmarks</code> directory</a>. So let's go
into the directory of a specific test; we'll use <code>clap-rs</code> as an
example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cd collector/benchmarks/clap-rs
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, let's say we want to profile the <code>cargo check</code>
performance. In that case, I would first run some basic commands to
build the dependencies:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash"># Setup: first clean out any old results and build the dependencies:
cargo +&lt;toolchain&gt; clean
CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 cargo +&lt;toolchain&gt; check
</code></pre>
<p>(Again, <code>&lt;toolchain&gt;</code> should be replaced with the name of the
toolchain we made in the first step.)</p>
<p>Next: we want record the execution time for <em>just</em> the clap-rs crate,
running cargo check. I tend to use <code>cargo rustc</code> for this, since it
also allows me to add explicit flags, which we'll do later on.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">touch src/lib.rs
CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 perf record -F99 --call-graph dwarf cargo rustc --profile check --lib
</code></pre>
<p>Note that final command: it's a doozy! It uses the <code>cargo rustc</code>
command, which executes rustc with (potentially) additional options;
the <code>--profile check</code> and <code>--lib</code> options specify that we are doing a
<code>cargo check</code> execution, and that this is a library (not a binary).</p>
<p>At this point, we can use <code>perf</code> tooling to analyze the results. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">perf report
</code></pre>
<p>will open up an interactive TUI program. In simple cases, that can be
helpful. For more detailed examination, the <a href="https://github.com/nikomatsakis/perf-focus"><code>perf-focus</code> tool</a>
can be helpful; it is covered below.</p>
<p><strong>A note of caution.</strong> Each of the rustc-perf tests is its own special
snowflake. In particular, some of them are not libraries, in which
case you would want to do <code>touch src/main.rs</code> and avoid passing
<code>--lib</code>. I'm not sure how best to tell which test is which to be
honest.</p>
<h3 id="gathering-nll-data"><a class="header" href="#gathering-nll-data">Gathering NLL data</a></h3>
<p>If you want to profile an NLL run, you can just pass extra options to
the <code>cargo rustc</code> command, like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">touch src/lib.rs
CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 perf record -F99 --call-graph dwarf cargo rustc --profile check --lib -- -Z borrowck=mir
</code></pre>
<h2 id="analyzing-a-perf-profile-with-perf-focus"><a class="header" href="#analyzing-a-perf-profile-with-perf-focus">Analyzing a perf profile with <code>perf focus</code></a></h2>
<p>Once you've gathered a perf profile, we want to get some information
about it. For this, I personally use <a href="https://github.com/nikomatsakis/perf-focus">perf focus</a>. It's a kind of
simple but useful tool that lets you answer queries like:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;how much time was spent in function F&quot; (no matter where it was called from)</li>
<li>&quot;how much time was spent in function F when it was called from G&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;how much time was spent in function F <em>excluding</em> time spent in G&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;what functions does F call and how much time does it spend in them&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>To understand how it works, you have to know just a bit about
perf. Basically, perf works by <em>sampling</em> your process on a regular
basis (or whenever some event occurs). For each sample, perf gathers a
backtrace. <code>perf focus</code> lets you write a regular expression that tests
which functions appear in that backtrace, and then tells you which
percentage of samples had a backtrace that met the regular
expression. It's probably easiest to explain by walking through how I
would analyze NLL performance.</p>
<h3 id="installing-perf-focus"><a class="header" href="#installing-perf-focus">Installing <code>perf-focus</code></a></h3>
<p>You can install perf-focus using <code>cargo install</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cargo install perf-focus
</code></pre>
<h3 id="example-how-much-time-is-spent-in-mir-borrowck"><a class="header" href="#example-how-much-time-is-spent-in-mir-borrowck">Example: How much time is spent in MIR borrowck?</a></h3>
<p>Let's say we've gathered the NLL data for a test. We'd like to know
how much time it is spending in the MIR borrow-checker. The &quot;main&quot;
function of the MIR borrowck is called <code>do_mir_borrowck</code>, so we can do
this command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ perf focus '{do_mir_borrowck}'
Matcher    : {do_mir_borrowck}
Matches    : 228
Not Matches: 542
Percentage : 29%
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>'{do_mir_borrowck}'</code> argument is called the <strong>matcher</strong>. It
specifies the test to be applied on the backtrace. In this case, the
<code>{X}</code> indicates that there must be <em>some</em> function on the backtrace
that meets the regular expression <code>X</code>. In this case, that regex is
just the name of the function we want (in fact, it's a subset of the name;
the full name includes a bunch of other stuff, like the module
path). In this mode, perf-focus just prints out the percentage of
samples where <code>do_mir_borrowck</code> was on the stack: in this case, 29%.</p>
<p><strong>A note about c++filt.</strong> To get the data from <code>perf</code>, <code>perf focus</code>
currently executes <code>perf script</code> (perhaps there is a better
way...). I've sometimes found that <code>perf script</code> outputs C++ mangled
names. This is annoying. You can tell by running <code>perf script | head</code> yourself — if you see names like <code>5rustc6middle</code> instead of
<code>rustc::middle</code>, then you have the same problem. You can solve this
by doing:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">perf script | c++filt | perf focus --from-stdin ...
</code></pre>
<p>This will pipe the output from <code>perf script</code> through <code>c++filt</code> and
should mostly convert those names into a more friendly format. The
<code>--from-stdin</code> flag to <code>perf focus</code> tells it to get its data from
stdin, rather than executing <code>perf focus</code>. We should make this more
convenient (at worst, maybe add a <code>c++filt</code> option to <code>perf focus</code>, or
just always use it — it's pretty harmless).</p>
<h3 id="example-how-much-time-does-mir-borrowck-spend-solving-traits"><a class="header" href="#example-how-much-time-does-mir-borrowck-spend-solving-traits">Example: How much time does MIR borrowck spend solving traits?</a></h3>
<p>Perhaps we'd like to know how much time MIR borrowck spends in the
trait checker. We can ask this using a more complex regex:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ perf focus '{do_mir_borrowck}..{^rustc::traits}'
Matcher    : {do_mir_borrowck},..{^rustc::traits}
Matches    : 12
Not Matches: 1311
Percentage : 0%
</code></pre>
<p>Here we used the <code>..</code> operator to ask &quot;how often do we have
<code>do_mir_borrowck</code> on the stack and then, later, some function whose
name begins with <code>rustc::traits</code>?&quot; (basically, code in that module). It
turns out the answer is &quot;almost never&quot; — only 12 samples fit that
description (if you ever see <em>no</em> samples, that often indicates your
query is messed up).</p>
<p>If you're curious, you can find out exactly which samples by using the
<code>--print-match</code> option. This will print out the full backtrace for
each sample. The <code>|</code> at the front of the line indicates the part that
the regular expression matched.</p>
<h3 id="example-where-does-mir-borrowck-spend-its-time"><a class="header" href="#example-where-does-mir-borrowck-spend-its-time">Example: Where does MIR borrowck spend its time?</a></h3>
<p>Often we want to do more &quot;explorational&quot; queries. Like, we know that
MIR borrowck is 29% of the time, but where does that time get spent?
For that, the <code>--tree-callees</code> option is often the best tool. You
usually also want to give <code>--tree-min-percent</code> or
<code>--tree-max-depth</code>. The result looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ perf focus '{do_mir_borrowck}' --tree-callees --tree-min-percent 3
Matcher    : {do_mir_borrowck}
Matches    : 577
Not Matches: 746
Percentage : 43%

: | rustc_mir_dataflow::do_dataflow (3% total, 0% self)
</code></pre>
<p>What happens with <code>--tree-callees</code> is that</p>
<ul>
<li>we find each sample matching the regular expression</li>
<li>we look at the code that is occurs <em>after</em> the regex match and try
to build up a call tree</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>--tree-min-percent 3</code> option says &quot;only show me things that take
more than 3% of the time. Without this, the tree often gets really
noisy and includes random stuff like the innards of
malloc. <code>--tree-max-depth</code> can be useful too, it just limits how many
levels we print.</p>
<p>For each line, we display the percent of time in that function
altogether (&quot;total&quot;) and the percent of time spent in <strong>just that
function and not some callee of that function</strong> (self). Usually
&quot;total&quot; is the more interesting number, but not always.</p>
<h3 id="relative-percentages"><a class="header" href="#relative-percentages">Relative percentages</a></h3>
<p>By default, all in perf-focus are relative to the <strong>total program
execution</strong>. This is useful to help you keep perspective — often as
we drill down to find hot spots, we can lose sight of the fact that,
in terms of overall program execution, this &quot;hot spot&quot; is actually not
important. It also ensures that percentages between different queries
are easily compared against one another.</p>
<p>That said, sometimes it's useful to get relative percentages, so <code>perf focus</code> offers a <code>--relative</code> option. In this case, the percentages are
listed only for samples that match (vs all samples). So for example we
could get our percentages relative to the borrowck itself
like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ perf focus '{do_mir_borrowck}' --tree-callees --relative --tree-max-depth 1 --tree-min-percent 5
Matcher    : {do_mir_borrowck}
Matches    : 577
Not Matches: 746
Percentage : 100%

: | rustc_mir_dataflow::do_dataflow (8% total, 1% self) [...]
</code></pre>
<p>Here you see that <code>compute_regions</code> came up as &quot;47% total&quot; — that
means that 47% of <code>do_mir_borrowck</code> is spent in that function. Before,
we saw 20% — that's because <code>do_mir_borrowck</code> itself is only 43% of
the total time (and <code>.47 * .43 = .20</code>).</p>

<h2 id="introducing-wpr-and-wpa"><a class="header" href="#introducing-wpr-and-wpa">Introducing WPR and WPA</a></h2>
<p>High-level performance analysis (including memory usage) can be performed with the Windows
Performance Recorder (WPR) and Windows Performance Analyzer (WPA). As the names suggest, WPR is for
recording system statistics (in the form of event trace log a.k.a. ETL files), while WPA is for
analyzing these ETL files.</p>
<p>WPR collects system wide statistics, so it won't just record things relevant to rustc but also
everything else that's running on the machine. During analysis, we can filter to just the things we
find interesting.</p>
<p>These tools are quite powerful but also require a bit of learning
before we can successfully profile the Rust compiler.</p>
<p>Here we will explore how to use WPR and WPA for analyzing the Rust compiler as well as provide
links to useful &quot;profiles&quot; (i.e., settings files that tweak the defaults for WPR and WPA) that are
specifically designed to make analyzing rustc easier.</p>
<h3 id="installing-wpr-and-wpa"><a class="header" href="#installing-wpr-and-wpa">Installing WPR and WPA</a></h3>
<p>You can install WPR and WPA as part of the Windows Performance Toolkit which itself is an option as
part of downloading the Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit (ADK). You can download the ADK
installer <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2086042">here</a>. Make sure to select the Windows
Performance Toolkit (you don't need to select anything else).</p>
<h2 id="recording"><a class="header" href="#recording">Recording</a></h2>
<p>In order to perform system analysis, you'll first need to record your system with WPR. Open WPR and
at the bottom of the window select the &quot;profiles&quot; of the things you want to record. For looking
into memory usage of the rustc bootstrap process, we'll want to select the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>CPU usage</li>
<li>VirtualAlloc usage</li>
</ul>
<p>You might be tempted to record &quot;Heap usage&quot; as well, but this records every single heap allocation
and can be very, very expensive. For high-level analysis, it might be best to leave that turned
off.</p>
<p>Now we need to get our setup ready to record. For memory usage analysis, it is best to record the
stage 2 compiler build with a stage 1 compiler build with debug symbols. Having symbols in the
compiler we're using to build rustc will aid our analysis greatly by allowing WPA to resolve Rust
symbols correctly. Unfortunately, the stage 0 compiler does not have symbols turned on which is why
we'll need to build a stage 1 compiler and then a stage 2 compiler ourselves.</p>
<p>To do this, make sure you have set <code>debuginfo-level = 1</code> in your <code>config.toml</code> file. This tells
rustc to generate debug information which includes stack frames when bootstrapping.</p>
<p>Now you can build the stage 1 compiler: <code>python x.py build --stage 1 -i library</code> or however
else you want to build the stage 1 compiler.</p>
<p>Now that the stage 1 compiler is built, we can record the stage 2 build. Go back to WPR, click the
&quot;start&quot; button and build the stage 2 compiler (e.g., <code>python x build --stage=2 -i library</code>).
When this process finishes, stop the recording.</p>
<p>Click the Save button and once that process is complete, click the &quot;Open in WPA&quot; button which
appears.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: The trace file is fairly large so it can take WPA some time to finish opening the file.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="analysis"><a class="header" href="#analysis">Analysis</a></h2>
<p>Now that our ETL file is open in WPA, we can analyze the results. First, we'll want to apply the
pre-made &quot;profile&quot; which will put WPA into a state conducive to analyzing rustc bootstrap. Download
the profile <a href="https://github.com/wesleywiser/rustc-bootstrap-wpa-analysis/releases/download/1/rustc.generic.wpaProfile">here</a>.
Select the &quot;Profiles&quot; menu at the top, then &quot;apply&quot; and then choose the downloaded profile.</p>
<p>You should see something resembling the following:</p>
<p><img src="profiling/../img/wpa-initial-memory.png" alt="WPA with profile applied" /></p>
<p>Next, we will need to tell WPA to load and process debug symbols so that it can properly demangle
the Rust stack traces. To do this, click &quot;Trace&quot; and then choose &quot;Load Symbols&quot;. This step can take
a while.</p>
<p>Once WPA has loaded symbols for rustc, we can expand the rustc.exe node and begin drilling down
into the stack with the largest allocations.</p>
<p>To do that, we'll expand the <code>[Root]</code> node in the &quot;Commit Stack&quot; column and continue expanding
until we find interesting stack frames.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip: After selecting the node you want to expand, press the right arrow key. This will expand the
node and put the selection on the next largest node in the expanded set. You can continue pressing
the right arrow key until you reach an interesting frame.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Rust compiler supports building with some dependencies from <code>crates.io</code>.
Examples are <code>log</code> and <code>env_logger</code>.</p>
<p>In general,
you should avoid adding dependencies to the compiler for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The dependency may not be of high quality or well-maintained.</li>
<li>The dependency may not be using a compatible license.</li>
<li>The dependency may have transitive dependencies that have one of the above
problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>As of <!-- date-check --> Aug 2022,
there is no official policy for vetting new dependencies to the compiler.
Decisions are made on a case-by-case basis,
during code review.</p>
<h2 id="permitted-dependencies"><a class="header" href="#permitted-dependencies">Permitted dependencies</a></h2>
<p>The <code>tidy</code> tool has <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/9d1b2106e23b1abd32fce1f17267604a5102f57a/src/tools/tidy/src/deps.rs#L73">a list of crates that are allowed</a>. To add a
dependency that is not already in the compiler, you will need to add it to the list.</p>

<h2 id="feature-requests"><a class="header" href="#feature-requests">Feature Requests</a></h2>
<p>Feature requests need to go through a process to be approved by the relevant
teams. Usually this requires a Final Comment Period (FCP) or even a Request for
Comments (RFC). See <a href="./getting-started.html">Getting Started</a> for more information about these processes.</p>
<h2 id="bug-reports"><a class="header" href="#bug-reports">Bug Reports</a></h2>
<p>While bugs are unfortunate, they're a reality in software. We can't fix what we
don't know about, so please report liberally. If you're not sure if something
is a bug or not, feel free to file a bug anyway.</p>
<p><strong>If you believe reporting your bug publicly represents a security risk to Rust users,
please follow our <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/security">instructions for reporting security vulnerabilities</a></strong>.</p>
<p>If you're using the nightly channel, please check if the bug exists in the
latest toolchain before filing your bug. It might be fixed already.</p>
<p>If you have the chance, before reporting a bug, please <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aissue">search existing
issues</a>,
as it's possible that someone else has already reported your error. This doesn't
always work, and sometimes it's hard to know what to search for, so consider this
extra credit. We won't mind if you accidentally file a duplicate report.</p>
<p>Similarly, to help others who encountered the bug find your issue, consider
filing an issue with a descriptive title, which contains information that might
be unique to it.  This can be the language or compiler feature used, the
conditions that trigger the bug, or part of the error message if there is any.
An example could be: <strong>&quot;impossible case reached&quot; on lifetime inference for impl
Trait in return position</strong>.</p>
<p>Opening an issue is as easy as following <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/new/choose">this

in the appropriate provided template.</p>
<h2 id="pull-requests"><a class="header" href="#pull-requests">Pull Requests</a></h2>
<p>Pull requests (or PRs for short) are the primary mechanism we use to change Rust.
GitHub itself has some <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests">great documentation</a> on using the
Pull Request feature. We use the &quot;fork and pull&quot; model <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/getting-started/about-collaborative-development-models#fork-and-pull-model">described here</a>,
where contributors push changes to their personal fork and create pull requests to
bring those changes into the source repository. We have more info about how to use git
when contributing to Rust under <a href="./git.html">the git section</a>.</p>
<h3 id="r"><a class="header" href="#r">r?</a></h3>
<p>All pull requests are reviewed by another person. We have a bot,
<a href="https://github.com/rustbot">@rustbot</a>, that will automatically assign a random person
to review your request based on which files you changed.</p>
<p>If you want to request that a specific person reviews your pull request, you
can add an <code>r?</code> to the pull request description or in a comment. For example,
if you want to ask a review to @awesome-reviewer, add</p>
<pre><code>r? @awesome-reviewer
</code></pre>
<p>to the end of the pull request description, and <a href="https://github.com/rustbot">@rustbot</a> will assign
them instead of a random person. This is entirely optional.</p>
<p>You can also assign a random reviewer from a specific team by writing <code>r? rust-lang/groupname</code>.
So if you were making a diagnostics change, then you could get a reviewer from the diagnostics
team by adding:</p>
<pre><code>r? rust-lang/diagnostics
</code></pre>
<p>For a full list of possible <code>groupname</code> check the <code>adhoc_groups</code> section at the
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/triagebot.toml">triagebot.toml config file</a>
or the list of teams in the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/team/tree/master/teams">rust-lang teams
database</a>.</p>
<h3 id="ci"><a class="header" href="#ci">CI</a></h3>
<p>In addition to being reviewed by a human, pull requests are automatically tested
thanks to continuous integration (CI). Basically, every time you open and update
a pull request, CI builds the compiler and tests it against the
<a href="tests/intro.html">compiler test suite</a>, and also performs other tests such as checking that
your pull request is in compliance with Rust's style guidelines.</p>
<p>Running continuous integration tests allows PR authors to catch mistakes early
without going through a first review cycle, and also helps reviewers stay aware
of the status of a particular pull request.</p>
<p>Rust has plenty of CI capacity, and you should never have to worry about wasting
computational resources each time you push a change. It is also perfectly fine
(and even encouraged!) to use the CI to test your changes if it can help your
productivity. In particular, we don't recommend running the full <code>./x.py test</code> suite locally,
since it takes a very long time to execute.</p>
<h3 id="r-1"><a class="header" href="#r-1">r+</a></h3>
<p>After someone has reviewed your pull request, they will leave an annotation
on the pull request with an <code>r+</code>. It will look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>@bors r+
</code></pre>
<p>This tells <a href="https://github.com/bors">@bors</a>, our lovable integration bot, that your pull request has
been approved. The PR then enters the <a href="https://bors.rust-lang.org/queue/rust">merge queue</a>, where <a href="https://github.com/bors">@bors</a>
will run <em>all</em> the tests on <em>every</em> platform we support. If it all works out,
<a href="https://github.com/bors">@bors</a> will merge your code into <code>master</code> and close the pull request.</p>
<p>Depending on the scale of the change, you may see a slightly different form of <code>r+</code>:</p>
<pre><code>@bors r+ rollup
</code></pre>
<p>The additional <code>rollup</code> tells <a href="https://github.com/bors">@bors</a> that this change should always be &quot;rolled up&quot;.
Changes that are rolled up are tested and merged alongside other PRs, to
speed the process up. Typically only small changes that are expected not to conflict
with one another are marked as &quot;always roll up&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="opening-a-pr"><a class="header" href="#opening-a-pr">Opening a PR</a></h3>
<p>You are now ready to file a pull request? Great! Here are a few points you
should be aware of.</p>
<p>All pull requests should be filed against the <code>master</code> branch, except in very
particular scenarios. Unless you know for sure that you should target another
branch, <code>master</code> will be the right choice (it's also the default).</p>
<p>Make sure your pull request is in compliance with Rust's style guidelines by running</p>
<pre><code>$ ./x.py test tidy --bless
</code></pre>
<p>We recommend to make this check before every pull request (and every new commit
in a pull request); you can add <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks">git hooks</a>
before every push to make sure you never forget to make this check. The
CI will also run tidy and will fail if tidy fails.</p>
<p>Rust follows a <em>no merge-commit policy</em>, meaning, when you encounter merge
conflicts you are expected to always rebase instead of merging.  E.g. always use
rebase when bringing the latest changes from the master branch to your feature
branch.</p>
<p>If you encounter merge conflicts or when a reviewer asks you to perform some
changes, your PR will get marked as <code>S-waiting-on-author</code>. When you resolve
them, you should use <code>@rustbot</code> to mark it as <code>S-waiting-on-review</code>:</p>
<pre><code>@rustbot label -S-waiting-on-author +S-waiting-on-review
</code></pre>
<p>See <a href="./rustbot.html#issue-relabeling">this chapter</a> for more details.</p>
<p>GitHub allows <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue">closing issues using keywords</a>. This feature
should be used to keep the issue tracker tidy. However, it is generally preferred
to put the &quot;closes #123&quot; text in the PR description rather than the issue commit;
particularly during rebasing, citing the issue number in the commit can &quot;spam&quot;
the issue in question.</p>
<h3 id="external-dependencies-subtree"><a class="header" href="#external-dependencies-subtree">External Dependencies (subtree)</a></h3>
<p>As a developer to this repository, you don't have to treat the following external projects
differently from other crates that are directly in this repo:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy">Clippy</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/miri">Miri</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt">rustfmt</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer">rust-analyzer</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In contrast to <code>submodule</code> dependencies
(see below for those), the <code>subtree</code> dependencies are just regular files and directories which can
be updated in tree. However, if possible, enhancements, bug fixes, etc. specific
to these tools should be filed against the tools directly in their respective
upstream repositories. The exception is that when rustc changes are required to
implement a new tool feature or test, that should happen in one collective rustc PR.</p>
<h4 id="synchronizing-a-subtree"><a class="header" href="#synchronizing-a-subtree">Synchronizing a subtree</a></h4>
<p>Periodically the changes made to subtree based dependencies need to be synchronized between this
repository and the upstream tool repositories.</p>
<p>Subtree synchronizations are typically handled by the respective tool maintainers. Other users
are welcome to submit synchronization PRs, however, in order to do so you you will need to modify
your local git installation and follow a very precise set of instructions.
These instructions are documented, along with several useful tips and tricks, in the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/clippy/development/infrastructure/sync.html">syncing subtree changes</a> section in Clippy's Contributing guide.
The instructions are applicable for use with any subtree based tool, just be sure to
use the correct corresponding subtree directory and remote repository.</p>
<p>The synchronization process goes in two directions: <code>subtree push</code> and <code>subtree pull</code>.</p>
<p>A <code>subtree push</code> takes all the changes that happened to the copy in this repo and creates commits
on the remote repo that match the local changes. Every local
commit that touched the subtree causes a commit on the remote repo, but
is modified to move the files from the specified directory to the tool repo root.</p>
<p>A <code>subtree pull</code> takes all changes since the last <code>subtree pull</code>
from the tool repo and adds these commits to the rustc repo along with a merge commit that moves
the tool changes into the specified directory in the Rust repository.</p>
<p>It is recommended that you always do a push first and get that merged to the tool master branch.
Then, when you do a pull, the merge works without conflicts.
While it's definitely possible to resolve conflicts during a pull, you may have to redo the conflict
resolution if your PR doesn't get merged fast enough and there are new conflicts. Do not try to
rebase the result of a <code>git subtree pull</code>, rebasing merge commits is a bad idea in general.</p>
<p>You always need to specify the <code>-P</code> prefix to the subtree directory and the corresponding remote
repository. If you specify the wrong directory or repository
you'll get very fun merges that try to push the wrong directory to the wrong remote repository.
Luckily you can just abort this without any consequences by throwing away either the pulled commits
in rustc or the pushed branch on the remote and try again. It is usually fairly obvious
that this is happening because you suddenly get thousands of commits that want to be synchronized.</p>
<h4 id="creating-a-new-subtree-dependency"><a class="header" href="#creating-a-new-subtree-dependency">Creating a new subtree dependency</a></h4>
<p>If you want to create a new subtree dependency from an existing repository, call (from this
repository's root directory!)</p>
<pre><code>git subtree add -P src/tools/clippy https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy.git master
</code></pre>
<p>This will create a new commit, which you may not rebase under any circumstances! Delete the commit
and redo the operation if you need to rebase.</p>
<p>Now you're done, the <code>src/tools/clippy</code> directory behaves as if Clippy were
part of the rustc monorepo, so no one but you (or others that synchronize
subtrees) actually needs to use <code>git subtree</code>.</p>
<h3 id="external-dependencies-submodules"><a class="header" href="#external-dependencies-submodules">External Dependencies (submodules)</a></h3>
<p>Building Rust will also use external git repositories tracked using <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules">git
submodules</a>. The complete list may be found in the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/.gitmodules"><code>.gitmodules</code></a> file. Some
of these projects are required (like <code>stdarch</code> for the standard library) and
some of them are optional (like <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/miri">Miri</a>).</p>
<p>Usage of submodules is discussed more in the <a href="git.html#git-submodules">Using Git
chapter</a>.</p>
<p>Some of the submodules are allowed to be in a &quot;broken&quot; state where they
either don't build or their tests don't pass, e.g. the documentation books
like <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/reference/">The Rust Reference</a>. Maintainers of these projects will be notified
when the project is in a broken state, and they should fix them as soon
as possible. The current status is tracked on the <a href="https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-toolstate/">toolstate website</a>.
More information may be found on the Forge <a href="https://forge.rust-lang.org/infra/toolstate.html">Toolstate chapter</a>.</p>
<p>Breakage is not allowed in the beta and stable channels, and must be addressed
before the PR is merged. They are also not allowed to be broken on master in
the week leading up to the beta cut.</p>
<h4 id="breaking-tools-built-with-the-compiler"><a class="header" href="#breaking-tools-built-with-the-compiler">Breaking Tools Built With The Compiler</a></h4>
<p>Rust's build system builds a number of tools that make use of the internals of
the compiler and that are hosted in a separate repository, and included in Rust
via git submodules (such as <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/miri">Miri</a>). If these tools break because of your
changes, you may run into a sort of &quot;chicken and egg&quot; problem. These tools rely
on the latest compiler to be built so you can't update them (in their own
repositories) to reflect your changes to the compiler until those changes are
merged into the compiler. At the same time, you can't get your changes merged
into the compiler because the rust-lang/rust build won't pass until those tools
build and pass their tests.</p>
<p>Luckily, a feature was
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/45861">added to Rust's build</a> to make
all of this easy to handle. The idea is that we allow these tools to be
&quot;broken&quot;, so that the rust-lang/rust build passes without trying to build them,
then land the change in the compiler, and go update the tools that you
broke. Some tools will require waiting for a nightly release before this can
happen, while others use the builds uploaded after each bors merge and thus can
be updated immediately (check the tool's documentation for details). Once you're
done and the tools are working again, you go back in the compiler and update the
tools so they can be distributed again.</p>
<p>This should avoid a bunch of synchronization dances and is also much easier on contributors as
there's no need to block on tools changes going upstream.</p>
<p>Here are those same steps in detail:</p>
<ol>
<li>(optional) First, if it doesn't exist already, create a <code>config.toml</code> by copying
<code>config.toml.example</code> in the root directory of the Rust repository.
Set <code>submodules = false</code> in the <code>[build]</code> section. This will prevent <code>x.py</code>
from resetting to the original branch after you make your changes. If you
need to <a href="contributing.html#updating-submodules">update any submodules to their latest versions</a>,
see the section of this file about that for more information.</li>
<li>(optional) Run <code>./x.py test src/tools/cargo</code> (substituting the submodule
that broke for <code>cargo</code>). Fix any errors in the submodule (and possibly others).</li>
<li>(optional) Make commits for your changes and send them to upstream repositories as a PR.</li>
<li>(optional) Maintainers of these submodules will <strong>not</strong> merge the PR. The PR can't be
merged because CI will be broken. You'll want to write a message on the PR referencing
your change, and how the PR should be merged once your change makes it into a nightly.</li>
<li>Wait for your PR to merge.</li>
<li>Wait for a nightly</li>
<li>(optional) Help land your PR on the upstream repository now that your changes are in nightly.</li>
<li>(optional) Send a PR to rust-lang/rust updating the submodule.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="writing-documentation"><a class="header" href="#writing-documentation">Writing Documentation</a></h2>
<p>Documentation improvements are very welcome. The source of <code>doc.rust-lang.org</code>
is located in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/doc"><code>src/doc</code></a> in the tree, and standard API documentation is generated
from the source code itself (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/library/std/src/lib.rs#L1"><code>lib.rs</code></a>). Documentation pull requests function
in the same way as other pull requests.</p>
<p>To find documentation-related issues, sort by the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen%20is%3Aissue%20label%3AA-docs">A-docs label</a>.</p>
<p>You can find documentation style guidelines in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1574-more-api-documentation-conventions.md#appendix-a-full-conventions-text">RFC 1574</a>.</p>
<p>In many cases, you don't need a full <code>./x.py doc --stage 2</code>, which will build
the entire stage 2 compiler and compile the various books published on
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org">doc.rust-lang.org</a>. When updating documentation for the standard library,
first try <code>./x.py doc library</code>. If that fails, or if you need to
see the output from the latest version of <code>rustdoc</code>, add <code>--stage 1</code>.
Results should appear in <code>build/host/doc</code>.</p>
<p>You can also use <code>rustdoc</code> directly to check small fixes. For example,
<code>rustdoc src/doc/reference.md</code> will render reference to <code>doc/reference.html</code>.

The issue tracker in that repo is also a great way to find things that need doing.
There are issues for beginners and advanced compiler devs alike!</p>
<p>Just a few things to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Please limit line length to 100 characters. This is enforced by CI, and you can run the checks
locally with <code>ci/check_line_lengths.sh</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When contributing text to the guide, please contextualize the information with some time period
and/or a reason so that the reader knows how much to trust or mistrust the information.
Aim to provide a reasonable amount of context, possibly including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A reason for why the data may be out of date other than &quot;change&quot;, as change is a constant across
the project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The date the comment was added, e.g. instead of writing <em>&quot;Currently, ...&quot;</em>
or <em>&quot;As of now, ...&quot;</em>,
consider adding the date, in one of the following formats:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jan 2021</li>
<li>January 2021</li>
<li>jan 2021</li>
<li>january 2021</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a CI action (in <code>~/.github/workflows/date-check.yml</code>)
that generates a monthly issue with any of these that are over 6 months old.</p>
<p>For the action to pick the date,
add a special annotation before specifying the date:</p>
<pre><code class="language-md">&lt;!-- date-check --&gt; Jan 2023
</code></pre>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-md">As of &lt;!-- date-check --&gt; Jan 2023, the foo did the bar.
</code></pre>
<p>For cases where the date should not be part of the visible rendered output,
use the following instead:</p>
<pre><code class="language-md">&lt;!-- date-check: Jan 2023 --&gt;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>A link to a relevant WG, tracking issue, <code>rustc</code> rustdoc page, or similar, that may provide
further explanation for the change process or a way to verify that the information is not
outdated.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a text grows rather long (more than a few page scrolls) or complicated (more than four
subsections) it might benefit from having a Table of Contents at the beginning, which you can
auto-generate by including the <code>&lt;!-- toc --&gt;</code> marker.</p>

<h2 id="issue-triage"><a class="header" href="#issue-triage">Issue Triage</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes, an issue will stay open, even though the bug has been fixed. And
sometimes, the original bug may go stale because something has changed in the
meantime.</p>
<p>It can be helpful to go through older bug reports and make sure that they are
still valid. Load up an older issue, double check that it's still true, and
leave a comment letting us know if it is or is not. The <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-asc">least recently
updated sort</a> is good for finding issues like this.</p>
<p><a href="./rustbot.html">Thanks to <code>@rustbot</code></a>, anyone can help triage issues by adding
appropriate labels to issues that haven't been triaged yet:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Yellow, <strong>A</strong>-prefixed labels state which <strong>area</strong> of the project an issue
relates to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Magenta, <strong>B</strong>-prefixed labels identify bugs which are <strong>blockers</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dark blue, <strong>beta-</strong> labels track changes which need to be backported into
the beta branches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Light purple, <strong>C</strong>-prefixed labels represent the <strong>category</strong> of an issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Green, <strong>E</strong>-prefixed labels explain the level of <strong>experience</strong> necessary
to fix the issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The dark blue <strong>final-comment-period</strong> label marks bugs that are using the
RFC signoff functionality of <a href="https://github.com/anp/rfcbot-rs/">rfcbot</a> and are currently in the final
comment period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Red, <strong>I</strong>-prefixed labels indicate the <strong>importance</strong> of the issue. The
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AI-nominated">I-nominated</a> label indicates that an issue has been nominated for
discussion at the next meeting of the team tagged using a
<strong>T</strong>-prefixed label. Similarly, the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AI-prioritize">I-prioritize</a> indicates
that an issue has been requested to be prioritized by the appropriate
team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The purple <strong>metabug</strong> label marks lists of bugs collected by other
categories.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Purple gray, <strong>O</strong>-prefixed labels are the <strong>operating system</strong> or platform
that this issue is specific to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Orange, <strong>P</strong>-prefixed labels indicate a bug's <strong>priority</strong>. These labels
can be assigned by anyone that understand the issue and is able to
prioritize it, and replace the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AI-prioritize">I-prioritize</a> label.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The gray <strong>proposed-final-comment-period</strong> label marks bugs that are using
the RFC signoff functionality of <a href="https://github.com/anp/rfcbot-rs/">rfcbot</a> and are currently awaiting
signoff of all team members in order to enter the final comment period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pink, <strong>regression</strong>-prefixed labels track regressions from stable to the
release channels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The light orange <strong>relnotes</strong> label marks issues that should be documented in
the release notes of the next release.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gray, <strong>S</strong>-prefixed labels are used for tracking the <strong>status</strong> of pull
requests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Blue, <strong>T</strong>-prefixed bugs denote which <strong>team</strong> the issue belongs to.</p>

<li>Google is always helpful when programming.
You can <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site:doc.rust-lang.org+your+query+here">search all Rust documentation</a> (the standard library,
the compiler, the books, the references, and the guides) to quickly find
information about the language and compiler.</li>
<li>You can also use Rustdoc's built-in search feature to find documentation on
types and functions within the crates you're looking at. You can also search
by type signature! For example, searching for <code>* -&gt; vec</code> should find all
functions that return a <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code>.

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="about-the-compiler-team"><a class="header" href="#about-the-compiler-team">About the compiler team</a></h1>
<p>rustc is maintained by the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/governance/teams/compiler">Rust compiler team</a>. The people who belong to
this team collectively work to track regressions and implement new features.
Members of the Rust compiler team are people who have made significant
contributions to rustc and its design.</p>
<h2 id="discussion"><a class="header" href="#discussion">Discussion</a></h2>
<p>Currently the compiler team chats in Zulip:</p>
<ul>
<li>Team chat occurs in the <a href="https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/131828-t-compiler"><code>t-compiler</code></a> stream on the Zulip instance</li>
<li>There are also a number of other associated Zulip streams,
such as <a href="https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/182449-t-compiler.2Fhelp"><code>t-compiler/help</code></a>, where people can ask for help
with rustc development, or <a href="https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/238009-t-compiler.2Fmeetings"><code>t-compiler/meetings</code></a>,
where the team holds their weekly triage and steering meetings.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="expert-map"><a class="header" href="#expert-map">Expert map</a></h2>
<p>If you're interested in figuring out who can answer questions about a
particular part of the compiler, or you'd just like to know who works on what,
check out our <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/blob/master/content/experts/map.toml">experts directory</a>.
It contains a listing of the various parts of the compiler and a list of people
who are experts on each one.</p>
<h2 id="rust-compiler-meeting"><a class="header" href="#rust-compiler-meeting">Rust compiler meeting</a></h2>
<p>The compiler team has a weekly meeting where we do triage and try to
generally stay on top of new bugs, regressions, and discuss important
things in general.
They are held on <a href="https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/238009-t-compiler.2Fmeetings">Zulip</a>. It works roughly as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Announcements, MCPs/FCPs, and WG-check-ins:</strong> We share some
announcements with the rest of the team about important things we want
everyone to be aware of. We also share the status of MCPs and FCPs and we
use the opportunity to have a couple of WGs giving us an update about
their work.</li>
<li><strong>Check for beta and stable nominations:</strong> These are nominations of things to
backport to beta and stable respectively.
We then look for new cases where the compiler broke previously working
code in the wild. Regressions are important issues to fix, so it's
likely that they are tagged as P-critical or P-high; the major
exception would be bug fixes (though even there we often <a href="./bug-fix-procedure.html">aim to give
warnings first</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Review P-critical and P-high bugs:</strong> P-critical and P-high bugs are
those that are sufficiently important for us to actively track
progress. P-critical and P-high bugs should ideally always have an
assignee.</li>
<li><strong>Check S-waiting-on-team and I-nominated issues:</strong> These are issues where feedback from
the team is desired.</li>
<li><strong>Look over the performance triage report:</strong> We check for PRs that made the
performance worse and try to decide if it's worth reverting the performance regression or if
the regression can be addressed in a future PR.</li>
</ul>
<p>The meeting currently takes place on Thursdays at 10am Boston time
(UTC-4 typically, but daylight savings time sometimes makes things
complicated).</p>
<h2 id="team-membership"><a class="header" href="#team-membership">Team membership</a></h2>
<p>Membership in the Rust team is typically offered when someone has been
making significant contributions to the compiler for some
time. Membership is both a recognition but also an obligation:
compiler team members are generally expected to help with upkeep as
well as doing reviews and other work.</p>
<p>If you are interested in becoming a compiler team member, the first
thing to do is to start fixing some bugs, or get involved in a working
group. One good way to find bugs is to look for
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AE-easy">open issues tagged with E-easy</a>
or
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AE-mentor">E-mentor</a>.</p>
<p>You can also dig through the graveyard of PRs that were
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pulls?q=is%3Apr+label%3AS-inactive">closed due to inactivity</a>,
some of them may contain work that is still useful - refer to the
associated issues, if any - and only needs some finishing touches
for which the original author didn't have time.</p>
<h3 id="r-rights"><a class="header" href="#r-rights">r+ rights</a></h3>
<p>Once you have made a number of individual PRs to rustc, we will often
offer r+ privileges. This means that you have the right to instruct
&quot;bors&quot; (the robot that manages which PRs get landed into rustc) to
merge a PR
(<a href="https://bors.rust-lang.org/">here are some instructions for how to talk to bors</a>).</p>
<p>The guidelines for reviewers are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are always welcome to review any PR, regardless of who it is
assigned to.  However, do not r+ PRs unless:
<ul>
<li>You are confident in that part of the code.</li>
<li>You are confident that nobody else wants to review it first.
<ul>
<li>For example, sometimes people will express a desire to review a
PR before it lands, perhaps because it touches a particularly
sensitive part of the code.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Always be polite when reviewing: you are a representative of the
Rust project, so it is expected that you will go above and beyond
when it comes to the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct">Code of Conduct</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="reviewer-rotation"><a class="header" href="#reviewer-rotation">Reviewer rotation</a></h3>
<p>Once you have r+ rights, you can also be added to the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/36285c5de8915ecc00d91ae0baa79a87ed5858d5/triagebot.toml#L528-L577">reviewer rotation</a>.
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/triagebot/">triagebot</a> is the bot that <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/triagebot/wiki/Assignment">automatically assigns</a> incoming PRs to reviewers.
If you are added, you will be randomly selected to review
PRs. If you find you are assigned a PR that you don't feel comfortable
reviewing, you can also leave a comment like <code>r? @so-and-so</code> to assign
to someone else — if you don't know who to request, just write <code>r? @nikomatsakis for reassignment</code> and @nikomatsakis will pick someone
for you.</p>
<p>Getting on the reviewer rotation is much appreciated as it lowers the
review burden for all of us! However, if you don't have time to give
people timely feedback on their PRs, it may be better that you don't
get on the list.</p>
<h3 id="full-team-membership"><a class="header" href="#full-team-membership">Full team membership</a></h3>
<p>Full team membership is typically extended once someone made many
contributions to the Rust compiler over time, ideally (but not
necessarily) to multiple areas. Sometimes this might be implementing a
new feature, but it is also important — perhaps more important! — to
have time and willingness to help out with general upkeep such as
bugfixes, tracking regressions, and other less glamorous work.</p>

<p>The Rust project uses <a href="https://git-scm.com">Git</a> to manage its source code. In order to
contribute, you'll need some familiarity with its features so that your changes
can be incorporated into the compiler.</p>
<p>The goal of this page is to cover some of the more common questions and
problems new contributors face. Although some Git basics will be covered here,
if you  find that this is still a little too fast for you, it might make sense
to first read some introductions to Git, such as the Beginner and Getting
started sections of <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control">this tutorial from Atlassian</a>. GitHub also
provides <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git">documentation</a> and <a href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/">guides</a> for beginners, or you can consult the
more in depth <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/">book from Git</a>.</p>
<p>This guide is incomplete. If you run into trouble with git that this page doesn't help with,
please <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-dev-guide/issues/new">open an issue</a> so we can document how to fix it.</p>
<h2 id="prerequisites-1"><a class="header" href="#prerequisites-1">Prerequisites</a></h2>
<p>We'll assume that you've installed Git, forked <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust">rust-lang/rust</a>, and cloned the
forked repo to your PC. We'll use the command line interface to interact
with Git; there are also a number of GUIs and IDE integrations that can
generally do the same things.</p>
<p>If you've cloned your fork, then you will be able to reference it with <code>origin</code>
in your local repo. It may be helpful to also set up a remote for the official
rust-lang/rust repo via</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">git remote add upstream https://github.com/rust-lang/rust.git
</code></pre>
<p>if you're using HTTPS, or</p>
<pre><code class="language-sh">git remote add upstream git@github.com:rust-lang/rust.git
</code></pre>
<p>if you're using SSH.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This page is dedicated to workflows for <code>rust-lang/rust</code>, but will likely be
useful when contributing to other repositories in the Rust project.</p>
<h2 id="standard-process"><a class="header" href="#standard-process">Standard Process</a></h2>
<p>Below is the normal procedure that you're likely to use for most minor changes
and PRs:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensure that you're making your changes on top of master:
<code>git checkout master</code>.</li>
<li>Get the latest changes from the Rust repo: <code>git pull upstream master --ff-only</code>.
(see <a href="git.html#keeping-things-up-to-date">No-Merge Policy</a> for more info about this).</li>
<li>Make a new branch for your change: <code>git checkout -b issue-12345-fix</code>.</li>
<li>Make some changes to the repo and test them.</li>
<li>Stage your changes via <code>git add src/changed/file.rs src/another/change.rs</code>
and then commit them with <code>git commit</code>. Of course, making intermediate commits
may be a good idea as well. Avoid <code>git add .</code>, as it makes it too easy to
unintentionally commit changes that should not be committed, such as submodule
updates. You can use <code>git status</code> to check if there are any files you forgot
to stage.</li>
<li>Push your changes to your fork: <code>git push --set-upstream origin issue-12345-fix</code>
(After adding commits, you can use <code>git push</code> and after rebasing or
pulling-and-rebasing, you can use <code>git push --force-with-lease</code>).</li>
<li><a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-a-pull-request">Open a PR</a> from your fork to <code>rust-lang/rust</code>'s master branch.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you end up needing to rebase and are hitting conflicts, see <a href="git.html#rebasing">Rebasing</a>.
If you want to track upstream while working on long-running feature/issue, see
<a href="git.html#keeping-things-up-to-date">Keeping things up to date</a>.</p>
<p>If your reviewer requests changes, the procedure for those changes looks much
the same, with some steps skipped:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensure that you're making changes to the most recent version of your code:
<code>git checkout issue-12345-fix</code>.</li>
<li>Make, stage, and commit your additional changes just like before.</li>
<li>Push those changes to your fork: <code>git push</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="troubleshooting-git-issues"><a class="header" href="#troubleshooting-git-issues">Troubleshooting git issues</a></h2>
<p>You don't need to clone <code>rust-lang/rust</code> from scratch if it's out of date!
Even if you think you've messed it up beyond repair, there are ways to fix
the git state that don't require downloading the whole repository again.
Here are some common issues you might run into:</p>
<h3 id="i-made-a-merge-commit-by-accident"><a class="header" href="#i-made-a-merge-commit-by-accident">I made a merge commit by accident.</a></h3>
<p>Git has two ways to update your branch with the newest changes: merging and rebasing.
Rust <a href="git.html#keeping-things-up-to-date">uses rebasing</a>. If you make a merge commit, it's not too hard to fix:
<code>git rebase -i upstream/master</code>.</p>
<p>See <a href="git.html#rebasing">Rebasing</a> for more about rebasing.</p>
<h3 id="i-deleted-my-fork-on-github"><a class="header" href="#i-deleted-my-fork-on-github">I deleted my fork on GitHub!</a></h3>
<p>This is not a problem from git's perspective. If you run <code>git remote -v</code>,
it will say something like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ git remote -v
origin  git@github.com:jyn514/rust.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:jyn514/rust.git (push)
upstream        https://github.com/rust-lang/rust (fetch)
upstream        https://github.com/rust-lang/rust (fetch)
</code></pre>
<p>If you renamed your fork, you can change the URL like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">git remote set-url origin &lt;URL&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>where the <code>&lt;URL&gt;</code> is your new fork.</p>
<h3 id="i-changed-a-submodule-by-accident"><a class="header" href="#i-changed-a-submodule-by-accident">I changed a submodule by accident</a></h3>
<p>Usually people notice this when rustbot posts a comment on github that <code>cargo</code> has been modified:</p>
<p><img src="./img/rustbot-submodules.png" alt="rustbot submodule comment" /></p>
<p>You might also notice conflicts in the web UI:</p>
<p><img src="./img/submodule-conflicts.png" alt="conflict in src/tools/cargo" /></p>
<p>The most common cause is that you rebased after a change and ran <code>git add .</code> without first running
<code>x.py</code> to update the submodules.  Alternatively, you might have run <code>cargo fmt</code> instead of <code>x fmt</code>
and modified files in a submodule, then committed the changes.</p>
<p>To fix it, do the following things:</p>
<ol>
<li>See which commit has the accidental changes: <code>git log --stat -n1 src/tools/cargo</code></li>
<li>Revert the changes to that commit: <code>git checkout &lt;my-commit&gt;~ src/tools/cargo</code>. Type <code>~</code>
literally but replace <code>&lt;my-commit&gt;</code> with the output from step 1.</li>
<li>Tell git to commit the changes: <code>git commit --fixup &lt;my-commit&gt;</code></li>
<li>Repeat steps 1-3 for all the submodules you modified.
<ul>
<li>If you modified the submodule in several different commits, you will need to repeat steps 1-3
for each commit you modified. You'll know when to stop when the <code>git log</code> command shows a commit
that's not authored by you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Squash your changes into the existing commits: <code>git rebase --autosquash -i upstream/master</code></li>
<li><a href="git.html#standard-process">Push your changes</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="i-see-error-cannot-rebase-when-i-try-to-rebase"><a class="header" href="#i-see-error-cannot-rebase-when-i-try-to-rebase">I see &quot;error: cannot rebase&quot; when I try to rebase</a></h3>
<p>These are two common errors to see when rebasing:</p>
<pre><code>error: cannot rebase: Your index contains uncommitted changes.
error: Please commit or stash them.
</code></pre>
<pre><code>error: cannot rebase: You have unstaged changes.
error: Please commit or stash them.
</code></pre>
<p>(See https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F#_the_three_states for the difference between the two.)</p>
<p>This means you have made changes since the last time you made a commit. To be able to rebase, either
commit your changes, or make a temporary commit called a &quot;stash&quot; to have them still not be commited
when you finish rebasing. You may want to configure git to make this &quot;stash&quot; automatically, which
will prevent the &quot;cannot rebase&quot; error in nearly all cases:</p>
<pre><code>git config --global rebase.autostash true
</code></pre>
<p>See https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Stashing-and-Cleaning for more info about stashing.</p>
<h3 id="i-see-untracked-files-srcstdarch"><a class="header" href="#i-see-untracked-files-srcstdarch">I see 'Untracked Files: src/stdarch'?</a></h3>
<p>This is left over from the move to the <code>library/</code> directory.
Unfortunately, <code>git rebase</code> does not follow renames for submodules, so you
have to delete the directory yourself:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">rm -r src/stdarch
</code></pre>
<h3 id="i-see--head"><a class="header" href="#i-see--head">I see <code>&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD</code>?</a></h3>
<p>You were probably in the middle of a rebase or merge conflict. See
<a href="git.html#conflicts">Conflicts</a> for how to fix the conflict. If you don't care about the changes
and just want to get a clean copy of the repository back, you can use <code>git reset</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console"># WARNING: this throws out any local changes you've made! Consider resolving the conflicts instead.
git reset --hard master

<p>If you see many commits in your rebase list, or merge commits, or commits by other people that you
didn't write, it likely means you're trying to rebase over the wrong branch. For example, you may
have a <code>rust-lang/rust</code> remote <code>upstream</code>, but ran <code>git rebase origin/master</code> instead of <code>git rebase upstream/master</code>. The fix is to abort the rebase and use the correct branch instead:</p>
<pre><code>git rebase --abort
git rebase -i upstream/master
</code></pre>

<h3 id="quick-note-about-submodules"><a class="header" href="#quick-note-about-submodules">Quick note about submodules</a></h3>
<p>When updating your local repository with <code>git pull</code>, you may notice that sometimes
Git says you have modified some files that you have never edited. For example,
running <code>git status</code> gives you something like (note the <code>new commits</code> mention):</p>
<pre><code>On branch master
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to update what will be committed)
  (use &quot;git restore &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to discard changes in working directory)
	modified:   src/llvm-project (new commits)
	modified:   src/tools/cargo (new commits)

no changes added to commit (use &quot;git add&quot; and/or &quot;git commit -a&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>These changes are not changes to files: they are changes to submodules (more on
this <a href="git.html#git-submodules">later</a>). To get rid of those, run <code>git submodule update</code>
(or run any <code>x.py</code> command, which will automatically update the submodules).
Note that,
as of <!-- date-check --> Aug 2022,
there is a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77620">bug</a> if you use worktrees,
submodules, and <code>x.py</code> in a commit hook.
If you run into an error like the following,
it's not anything you did wrong:</p>
<pre><code>error: failed to read `/home/joshua/rustc-worktree/src/tools/miri/cargo-miri/Cargo.toml`

Caused by:
  No such file or directory (os error 2)
</code></pre>
<p>There is a workaround in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/77620#issuecomment-705228229">the issue</a>.</p>
<p>(Note that as of Sept 2022 <code>miri</code> is a subtree and not a submodule.)</p>
<h2 id="rebasing-and-conflicts"><a class="header" href="#rebasing-and-conflicts">Rebasing and Conflicts</a></h2>
<p>When you edit your code locally, you are making changes to the version of
rust-lang/rust that existed when you created your feature branch. As such, when
you submit your PR it is possible that some of the changes that have been made
to rust-lang/rust since then are in conflict with the changes you've made.</p>
<p>When this happens, you need to resolve the conflicts before your changes can be
merged. First, get a local copy of the conflicting changes: Checkout your local
master branch with <code>git checkout master</code>, then <code>git pull upstream master</code> to
update it with the most recent changes.</p>
<h3 id="rebasing"><a class="header" href="#rebasing">Rebasing</a></h3>
<p>You're now ready to start the rebasing process. Checkout the branch with your
changes and execute <code>git rebase master</code>.</p>
<p>When you rebase a branch on master, all the changes on your branch are
reapplied to the most recent version of master. In other words, Git tries to
pretend that the changes you made to the old version of master were instead
made to the new version of master. During this process, you should expect to
encounter at least one &quot;rebase conflict.&quot; This happens when Git's attempt to
reapply the changes fails because your changes conflicted with other changes
that have been made. You can tell that this happened because you'll see
lines in the output that look like</p>
<pre><code>CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in file.rs
</code></pre>
<p>When you open these files, you'll see sections of the form</p>
<pre><code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD
Original code
=======
Your code
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 8fbf656... Commit fixes 12345
</code></pre>
<p>This represents the lines in the file that Git could not figure out how to
rebase. The section between <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD</code> and <code>=======</code> has the code from
master, while the other side has your version of the code. You'll need to
decide how to deal with the conflict. You may want to keep your changes,
keep the changes on master, or combine the two.</p>
<p>Generally, resolving the conflict consists of two steps: First, fix the
particular conflict. Edit the file to make the changes you want and remove the
<code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</code>, <code>=======</code> and <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> lines in the process. Second, check the
surrounding code. If there was a conflict, its likely there are some logical
errors lying around too! It's a good idea to run <code>x.py check</code> here to make sure
there are no glaring errors.</p>
<p>Once you're all done fixing the conflicts, you need to stage the files that had
conflicts in them via <code>git add</code>. Afterwards, run <code>git rebase --continue</code> to let
Git know that you've resolved the conflicts and it should finish the rebase.</p>
<p>Once the rebase has succeeded, you'll want to update the associated branch on
your fork with <code>git push --force-with-lease</code>.</p>
<p>Note that <code>git push</code> will not work properly and say something like this:</p>
<pre><code> ! [rejected]        issue-xxxxx -&gt; issue-xxxxx (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/username/rust.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.
hint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
</code></pre>
<p>The advice this gives is incorrect! Because of Rust's
<a href="git.html#no-merge-policy">&quot;no-merge&quot; policy</a> the merge commit created by <code>git pull</code>
will not be allowed in the final PR, in addition to defeating the point of the
rebase! Use <code>git push --force-with-lease</code> instead.</p>
<h3 id="keeping-things-up-to-date"><a class="header" href="#keeping-things-up-to-date">Keeping things up to date</a></h3>
<p>The above section on <a href="git.html#rebasing">Rebasing</a> is a specific
guide on rebasing work and dealing with merge conflicts.
Here is some general advice about how to keep your local repo
up-to-date with upstream changes:</p>
<p>Using <code>git pull upstream master</code> while on your local master branch regularly
will keep it up-to-date. You will also want to rebase your feature branches
up-to-date as well. After pulling, you can checkout the feature branches
and rebase them:</p>
<pre><code>git checkout master
git pull upstream master --ff-only # to make certain there are no merge commits
git rebase master feature_branch
git push --force-with-lease # (set origin to be the same as local)
</code></pre>
<p>To avoid merges as per the <a href="git.html#no-merge-policy">No-Merge Policy</a>, you may want to use
<code>git config pull.ff only</code> (this will apply the config only to the local repo)
to ensure that Git doesn't create merge commits when <code>git pull</code>ing, without
needing to pass <code>--ff-only</code> or <code>--rebase</code> every time.</p>
<p>You can also <code>git push --force-with-lease</code> from master to keep your fork's master in sync with
upstream.</p>
<h2 id="advanced-rebasing"><a class="header" href="#advanced-rebasing">Advanced Rebasing</a></h2>
<p>If your branch contains multiple consecutive rewrites of the same code, or if
the rebase conflicts are extremely severe, you can use
<code>git rebase --interactive master</code> to gain more control over the process. This
allows you to choose to skip commits, edit the commits that you do not skip,
change the order in which they are applied, or &quot;squash&quot; them into each other.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can sacrifice the commit history like this:</p>
<pre><code># squash all the changes into one commit so you only have to worry about conflicts once
git rebase -i $(git merge-base master HEAD)  # and squash all changes along the way
git rebase master
# fix all merge conflicts
git rebase --continue
</code></pre>
<p>&quot;Squashing&quot; commits into each other causes them to be merged into a single
commit. Both the upside and downside of this is that it simplifies the history.
On the one hand, you lose track of the steps in which changes were made, but
the history becomes easier to work with.</p>
<p>You also may want to squash just the last few commits together, possibly
because they only represent &quot;fixups&quot; and not real changes. For example,
<code>git rebase --interactive HEAD~2</code> will allow you to edit the two commits only.</p>
<h3 id="git-range-diff"><a class="header" href="#git-range-diff"><code>git range-diff</code></a></h3>
<p>After completing a rebase, and before pushing up your changes, you may want to
review the changes between your old branch and your new one. You can do that
with <code>git range-diff master @{upstream} HEAD</code>.</p>
<p>The first argument to <code>range-diff</code>, <code>master</code> in this case, is the base revision
that you're comparing your old and new branch against. The second argument is
the old version of your branch; in this case, <code>@upstream</code> means the version that
you've pushed to GitHub, which is the same as what people will see in your pull
request. Finally, the third argument to <code>range-diff</code> is the <em>new</em> version of
your branch; in this case, it is <code>HEAD</code>, which is the commit that is currently
checked-out in your local repo.</p>
<p>Note that you can also use the equivalent, abbreviated form <code>git range-diff master @{u} HEAD</code>.</p>
<p>Unlike in regular Git diffs, you'll see a <code>-</code> or <code>+</code> next to another <code>-</code> or <code>+</code>
in the range-diff output. The marker on the left indicates a change between the
old branch and the new branch, and the marker on the right indicates a change
you've committed. So, you can think of a range-diff as a &quot;diff of diffs&quot; since
it shows you the differences between your old diff and your new diff.</p>
<p>Here's an example of <code>git range-diff</code> output (taken from <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-range-diff#_examples">Git's
docs</a>):</p>

</code></pre>
<p>(Note that <code>git range-diff</code> output in your terminal will probably be easier to
read than in this example because it will have colors.)</p>
<p>Another feature of <code>git range-diff</code> is that, unlike <code>git diff</code>, it will also
diff commit messages. This feature can be useful when amending several commit
messages so you can make sure you changed the right parts.</p>
<p><code>git range-diff</code> is a very useful command, but note that it can take some time
to get used to its output format. You may also find Git's documentation on the
command useful, especially their <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-range-diff#_examples">&quot;Examples&quot; section</a>.</p>
<h2 id="no-merge-policy"><a class="header" href="#no-merge-policy">No-Merge Policy</a></h2>
<p>The rust-lang/rust repo uses what is known as a &quot;rebase workflow.&quot; This means
that merge commits in PRs are not accepted. As a result, if you are running
<code>git merge</code> locally, chances are good that you should be rebasing instead. Of
course, this is not always true; if your merge will just be a fast-forward,
like the merges that <code>git pull</code> usually performs, then no merge commit is
created and you have nothing to worry about. Running <code>git config merge.ff only</code>
(this will apply the config to the local repo).
once will ensure that all the merges you perform are of this type, so that you
cannot make a mistake.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons for this decision and like all others, it is a
tradeoff. The main advantage is the generally linear commit history. This
greatly simplifies bisecting and makes the history and commit log much easier
to follow and understand.</p>
<h2 id="tips-for-reviewing"><a class="header" href="#tips-for-reviewing">Tips for reviewing</a></h2>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: This section is for <em>reviewing</em> PRs, not authoring them.</p>
<h3 id="hiding-whitespace"><a class="header" href="#hiding-whitespace">Hiding whitespace</a></h3>

<p>Git and Github's default diff view for large moves <em>within</em> a file is quite poor; it will show each
line as deleted and each line as added, forcing you to compare each line yourself. Git has an option
to show moved lines in a different color:</p>
<pre><code>git log -p --color-moved=dimmed-zebra --color-moved-ws=allow-indentation-change

<p>See <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff#Documentation/git-diff.txt---color-movedltmodegt">the docs for <code>--color-moved</code></a> for more info.</p>
<h3 id="range-diff"><a class="header" href="#range-diff">range-diff</a></h3>
<p>See <a href="git.html#git-range-diff">the relevant section for PR authors</a>. This can be useful for comparing code

<h2 id="git-submodules"><a class="header" href="#git-submodules">Git submodules</a></h2>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: submodules are a nice thing to know about, but it <em>isn't</em> an absolute
prerequisite to contribute to <code>rustc</code>. If you are using Git for the first time,
you might want to get used to the main concepts of Git before reading this section.</p>
<p>The <code>rust-lang/rust</code> repository uses <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules">Git submodules</a> as a way to use other
Rust projects from within the <code>rust</code> repo. Examples include Rust's fork of
<code>llvm-project</code>, <code>cargo</code>  and libraries like <code>stdarch</code> and <code>backtrace</code>.</p>
<p>Those projects are developed and maintained in an separate Git (and GitHub)
repository, and they have their own Git history/commits, issue tracker and PRs.
Submodules allow us to create some sort of embedded sub-repository inside the
<code>rust</code> repository and use them like they were directories in the <code>rust</code> repository.</p>
<p>Take <code>llvm-project</code> for example. <code>llvm-project</code> is maintained in the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/llvm-project"><code>rust-lang/llvm-project</code></a>
repository, but it is used in <code>rust-lang/rust</code> by the compiler for code generation and
optimization. We bring it in <code>rust</code> as a submodule, in the <code>src/llvm-project</code> folder.</p>
<p>The contents of submodules are ignored by Git: submodules are in some sense isolated
from the rest of the repository. However, if you try to <code>cd src/llvm-project</code> and then
run <code>git status</code>:</p>
<pre><code>HEAD detached at 9567f08afc943
nothing to commit, working tree clean
</code></pre>
<p>As far as git is concerned, you are no longer in the <code>rust</code> repo, but in the <code>llvm-project</code> repo.
You will notice that we are in &quot;detached HEAD&quot; state, i.e. not on a branch but on a
particular commit.</p>
<p>This is because, like any dependency, we want to be able to control which version to use.
Submodules allow us to do just that: every submodule is &quot;pinned&quot; to a certain
commit, which doesn't change unless modified manually. If you use <code>git checkout &lt;commit&gt;</code>
in the <code>llvm-project</code> directory and go back to the <code>rust</code> directory, you can stage this
change like any other, e.g. by running <code>git add src/llvm-project</code>. (Note that if
you <em>don't</em> stage the change to commit, then you run the risk that running
<code>x.py</code> will just undo your change by switching back to the previous commit when
it automatically &quot;updates&quot; the submodules.)</p>
<p>This version selection is usually done by the maintainers of the project, and
looks like <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/99464/files">this</a>.</p>
<p>Git submodules take some time to get used to, so don't worry if it isn't perfectly
clear yet. You will rarely have to use them directly and, again, you don't need
to know everything about submodules to contribute to Rust. Just know that they
exist and that they correspond to some sort of embedded subrepository dependency
that Git can nicely and fairly conveniently handle for us.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="mastering-rustbot"><a class="header" href="#mastering-rustbot">Mastering @rustbot</a></h1>
<p><code>@rustbot</code> (also known as <code>triagebot</code>) is a utility robot that is mostly used to
allow any contributor to achieve certain tasks that would normally require GitHub
membership to the <code>rust-lang</code> organization. Its most interesting features for
contributors to <code>rustc</code> are issue claiming and relabeling.</p>
<h2 id="issue-claiming"><a class="header" href="#issue-claiming">Issue claiming</a></h2>
<p><code>@rustbot</code> exposes a command that allows anyone to assign an issue to themselves.
If you see an issue you want to work on, you can send the following message as a
comment on the issue at hand:</p>
<pre><code>@rustbot claim
</code></pre>
<p>This will tell <code>@rustbot</code> to assign the issue to you if it has no assignee yet.
Note that because of some GitHub restrictions, you may be assigned indirectly,
i.e. <code>@rustbot</code> will assign itself as a placeholder and edit the top comment to
reflect the fact that the issue is now assigned to you.</p>
<p>If you want to unassign from an issue, <code>@rustbot</code> has a different command:</p>
<pre><code>@rustbot release-assignment
</code></pre>
<h2 id="issue-relabeling"><a class="header" href="#issue-relabeling">Issue relabeling</a></h2>
<p>Changing labels for an issue or PR is also normally reserved for members of the
organization. However, <code>@rustbot</code> allows you to relabel an issue yourself, only
with a few restrictions. This is mostly useful in two cases:</p>
<p><strong>Helping with issue triage</strong>: Rust's issue tracker has more than 5,000 open
issues at the time of this writing, so labels are the most powerful tool that we
have to keep it as tidy as possible. You don't need to spend hours in the issue tracker
to triage issues, but if you open an issue, you should feel free to label it if
you are comfortable with doing it yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Updating the status of a PR</strong>: We use &quot;status labels&quot; to reflect the status of
PRs. For example, if your PR has merge conflicts, it will automatically be assigned
the <code>S-waiting-on-author</code>, and reviewers might not review it until you rebase your
PR. Once you do rebase your branch, you should change the labels yourself to remove
the <code>S-waiting-on-author</code> label and add back <code>S-waiting-on-review</code>. In this case,
the <code>@rustbot</code> command will look like this:</p>
<pre><code>@rustbot label -S-waiting-on-author +S-waiting-on-review
</code></pre>
<p>The syntax for this command is pretty loose, so there are other variants of this
command invocation. For more details, see <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/triagebot/wiki/Labeling">the wiki page about labeling</a>.</p>
<h2 id="other-commands"><a class="header" href="#other-commands">Other commands</a></h2>
<p>If you are interested in seeing what <code>@rustbot</code> is capable of, check out its <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/triagebot/wiki">wiki</a>,
which is meant as a reference for the bot and should be kept up to date every time the
bot gets an upgrade.</p>

existing commands or suggestions for new commands, feel free to reach out

<p>There are <em>a lot</em> of ways to contribute to the Rust compiler, including fixing
bugs, improving performance, helping design features, providing feedback on
existing features, etc. This chapter does not claim to scratch the surface.
Instead, it walks through the design and implementation of a new feature. Not
all of the steps and processes described here are needed for every
contribution, and I will try to point those out as they arise.</p>
<p>In general, if you are interested in making a contribution and aren't sure
where to start, please feel free to ask!</p>
<h2 id="overview"><a class="header" href="#overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>The feature I will discuss in this chapter is the <code>?</code> Kleene operator for
macros. Basically, we want to be able to write something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">macro_rules! foo {
    ($arg:ident $(, $optional_arg:ident)?) =&gt; {
        println!(&quot;{}&quot;, $arg);

        $(
            println!(&quot;{}&quot;, $optional_arg);
        )?
    }
}

fn main() {
    let x = 0;
    foo!(x); // ok! prints &quot;0&quot;
    foo!(x, x); // ok! prints &quot;0 0&quot;
}
</code></pre>
<p>So basically, the <code>$(pat)?</code> matcher in the macro means &quot;this pattern can occur
0 or 1 times&quot;, similar to other regex syntaxes.</p>
<p>There were a number of steps to go from an idea to stable Rust feature. Here is
a quick list.  We will go through each of these in order below. As I mentioned
before, not all of these are needed for every type of contribution.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Idea discussion/Pre-RFC</strong>  A Pre-RFC is an early draft or design discussion
of a feature. This stage is intended to flesh out the design space a bit and
get a grasp on the different merits and problems with an idea. It's a great
way to get early feedback on your idea before presenting it the wider
audience. You can find the original discussion <a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/pre-rfc-at-most-one-repetition-macro-patterns/6557">here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>RFC</strong>  This is when you formally present your idea to the community for
consideration. You can find the RFC <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2298">here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Implementation</strong> Implement your idea unstably in the compiler. You can
find the original implementation <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/47752">here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Possibly iterate/refine</strong> As the community gets experience with your
feature on the nightly compiler and in <code>std</code>, there may be additional
feedback about design choice that might be adjusted. This particular feature
went <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/49719">through</a> a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/51336">number</a> of <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/51587">iterations</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Stabilization</strong> When your feature has baked enough, a Rust team member may
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/48075#issuecomment-433177613">propose to stabilize it</a>. If there is consensus, this is done.</li>
<li><strong>Relax</strong> Your feature is now a stable Rust feature!</li>
</ul>

<p>Before opening an RFC, you should do the research to &quot;flesh out&quot; your idea.
Hastily-proposed RFCs tend not to be accepted. You should generally have a good
description of the motivation, impact, disadvantages, and potential
interactions with other features.</p>
<p>If that sounds like a lot of work, it's because it is. But no fear! Even if
you're not a compiler hacker, you can get great feedback by doing a <em>pre-RFC</em>.
This is an <em>informal</em> discussion of the idea. The best place to do this is
internals.rust-lang.org. Your post doesn't have to follow any particular
structure.  It doesn't even need to be a cohesive idea. Generally, you will get
tons of feedback that you can integrate back to produce a good RFC.</p>
<p>(Another pro-tip: try searching the RFCs repo and internals for prior related
ideas. A lot of times an idea has already been considered and was either
rejected or postponed to be tried again later. This can save you and everybody
else some time)</p>
<p>In the case of our example, a participant in the pre-RFC thread pointed out a
syntax ambiguity and a potential resolution. Also, the overall feedback seemed
positive. In this case, the discussion converged pretty quickly, but for some
ideas, a lot more discussion can happen (e.g. see <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2457">this RFC</a> which
received a whopping 684 comments!). If that happens, don't be discouraged; it
means the community is interested in your idea, but it perhaps needs some
adjustments.</p>
<p>The RFC for our <code>?</code> macro feature did receive some discussion on the RFC thread
too.  As with most RFCs, there were a few questions that we couldn't answer by
discussion: we needed experience using the feature to decide. Such questions
are listed in the &quot;Unresolved Questions&quot; section of the RFC. Also, over the
course of the RFC discussion, you will probably want to update the RFC document
itself to reflect the course of the discussion (e.g. new alternatives or prior
work may be added or you may decide to change parts of the proposal itself).</p>
<p>In the end, when the discussion seems to reach a consensus and die down a bit,
a Rust team member may propose to move to &quot;final comment period&quot; (FCP) with one
of three possible dispositions. This means that they want the other members of
the appropriate teams to review and comment on the RFC. More discussion may
ensue, which may result in more changes or unresolved questions being added. At
some point, when everyone is satisfied, the RFC enters the FCP, which is the
last chance for people to bring up objections. When the FCP is over, the
disposition is adopted. Here are the three possible dispositions:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Merge</em>: accept the feature. Here is the proposal to merge for our <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2298#issuecomment-360582667"><code>?</code> macro
feature</a>.</li>
<li><em>Close</em>: this feature in its current form is not a good fit for rust. Don't
be discouraged if this happens to your RFC, and don't take it personally.
This is not a reflection on you, but rather a community decision that rust
will go a different direction.</li>
<li><em>Postpone</em>: there is interest in going this direction but not at the moment.
This happens most often because the appropriate Rust team doesn't have the
bandwidth to shepherd the feature through the process to stabilization. Often
this is the case when the feature doesn't fit into the team's roadmap.
Postponed ideas may be revisited later.</li>
</ul>
<p>When an RFC is merged, the PR is merged into the RFCs repo. A new <em>tracking
issue</em> is created in the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust">rust-lang/rust</a> repo to track progress on the feature
and discuss unresolved questions, implementation progress and blockers, etc.
Here is the tracking issue on for our <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/48075"><code>?</code> macro feature</a>.</p>
<p><a name="impl"></a></p>
<h2 id="implementation"><a class="header" href="#implementation">Implementation</a></h2>
<p>To make a change to the compiler, open a PR against the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust">rust-lang/rust</a> repo.</p>
<p>Depending on the feature/change/bug fix/improvement, implementation may be
relatively-straightforward or it may be a major undertaking. You can always ask
for help or mentorship from more experienced compiler devs.  Also, you don't
have to be the one to implement your feature; but keep in mind that if you
don't it might be a while before someone else does.</p>
<p>For the <code>?</code> macro feature, I needed to go understand the relevant parts of
macro expansion in the compiler. Personally, I find that <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/47732">improving the
comments</a> in the code is a helpful way of making sure I understand
it, but you don't have to do that if you don't want to.</p>
<p>I then <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/47752">implemented</a> the original feature, as described in the RFC. When
a new feature is implemented, it goes behind a <em>feature gate</em>, which means that
you have to use <code>#![feature(my_feature_name)]</code> to use the feature. The feature
gate is removed when the feature is stabilized.</p>
<p><strong>Most bug fixes and improvements</strong> don't require a feature gate. You can just
make your changes/improvements.</p>
<p>When you open a PR on the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust">rust-lang/rust</a>, a bot will assign your PR to a
review. If there is a particular Rust team member you are working with, you can
request that reviewer by leaving a comment on the thread with <code>r? @reviewer-github-id</code> (e.g. <code>r? @eddyb</code>). If you don't know who to request,
don't request anyone; the bot will assign someone automatically based on which files you changed.</p>
<p>The reviewer may request changes before they approve your PR. Feel free to ask
questions or discuss things you don't understand or disagree with. However,
recognize that the PR won't be merged unless someone on the Rust team approves
it.</p>
<p>When your reviewer approves the PR, it will go into a queue for yet another bot
called <code>@bors</code>. <code>@bors</code> manages the CI build/merge queue. When your PR reaches
the head of the <code>@bors</code> queue, <code>@bors</code> will test out the merge by running all
tests against your PR on GitHub Actions. This takes a lot of time to
finish. If all tests pass, the PR is merged and becomes part of the next
nightly compiler!</p>
<p>There are a couple of things that may happen for some PRs during the review process</p>
<ul>
<li>If the change is substantial enough, the reviewer may request an FCP on
the PR. This gives all members of the appropriate team a chance to review the
changes.</li>
<li>If the change may cause breakage, the reviewer may request a <a href="./tests/intro.html#crater">crater</a> run.
This compiles the compiler with your changes and then attempts to compile all
crates on crates.io with your modified compiler. This is a great smoke test
to check if you introduced a change to compiler behavior that affects a large
portion of the ecosystem.</li>
<li>If the diff of your PR is large or the reviewer is busy, your PR may have
some merge conflicts with other PRs that happen to get merged first. You
should fix these merge conflicts using the normal git procedures.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are not doing a new feature or something like that (e.g. if you are
fixing a bug), then that's it! Thanks for your contribution :)</p>
<h2 id="refining-your-implementation"><a class="header" href="#refining-your-implementation">Refining your implementation</a></h2>
<p>As people get experience with your new feature on nightly, slight changes may
be proposed and unresolved questions may become resolved. Updates/changes go
through the same process for implementing any other changes, as described
above (i.e. submit a PR, go through review, wait for <code>@bors</code>, etc).</p>
<p>Some changes may be major enough to require an FCP and some review by Rust team
members.</p>
<p>For the <code>?</code> macro feature, we went through a few different iterations after the
original implementation: <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/49719">1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/51336">2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/51587">3</a>.</p>
<p>Along the way, we decided that <code>?</code> should not take a separator, which was
previously an unresolved question listed in the RFC. We also changed the
disambiguation strategy: we decided to remove the ability to use <code>?</code> as a
separator token for other repetition operators (e.g. <code>+</code> or <code>*</code>). However,
since this was a breaking change, we decided to do it over an edition boundary.
Thus, the new feature can be enabled only in edition 2018. These deviations
from the original RFC required <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/51934">another
FCP</a>.</p>
<h2 id="stabilization"><a class="header" href="#stabilization">Stabilization</a></h2>
<p>Finally, after the feature had baked for a while on nightly, a language team member
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/48075#issuecomment-433177613">moved to stabilize it</a>.</p>
<p>A <em>stabilization report</em> needs to be written that includes</p>
<ul>
<li>brief description of the behavior and any deviations from the RFC</li>
<li>which edition(s) are affected and how</li>
<li>links to a few tests to show the interesting aspects</li>
</ul>
<p>The stabilization report for our feature is <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/48075#issuecomment-433243048">here</a>.</p>
<p>After this, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/56245">a PR is made</a> to remove the feature gate, enabling the feature by
default (on the 2018 edition). A note is added to the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/RELEASES.md">Release notes</a>
about the feature.</p>
<p>Steps to stabilize the feature can be found at <a href="./stabilization_guide.html">Stabilizing Features</a>.</p>

<p>This page defines the best practices procedure for making bug fixes or soundness
corrections in the compiler that can cause existing code to stop compiling. This
text is based on
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1589-rustc-bug-fix-procedure.md">RFC 1589</a>.</p>
<h1 id="motivation"><a class="header" href="#motivation">Motivation</a></h1>
<p>From time to time, we encounter the need to make a bug fix, soundness
correction, or other change in the compiler which will cause existing code to
stop compiling. When this happens, it is important that we handle the change in
a way that gives users of Rust a smooth transition. What we want to avoid is
that existing programs suddenly stop compiling with opaque error messages: we
would prefer to have a gradual period of warnings, with clear guidance as to
what the problem is, how to fix it, and why the change was made. This RFC
describes the procedure that we have been developing for handling breaking
changes that aims to achieve that kind of smooth transition.</p>
<p>One of the key points of this policy is that (a) warnings should be issued
initially rather than hard errors if at all possible and (b) every change that
causes existing code to stop compiling will have an associated tracking issue.
This issue provides a point to collect feedback on the results of that change.
Sometimes changes have unexpectedly large consequences or there may be a way to
avoid the change that was not considered. In those cases, we may decide to
change course and roll back the change, or find another solution (if warnings
are being used, this is particularly easy to do).</p>
<h3 id="what-qualifies-as-a-bug-fix"><a class="header" href="#what-qualifies-as-a-bug-fix">What qualifies as a bug fix?</a></h3>
<p>Note that this RFC does not try to define when a breaking change is permitted.
That is already covered under <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1122-language-semver.md">RFC 1122</a>. This document assumes that the
change being made is in accordance with those policies. Here is a summary of the
conditions from RFC 1122:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Soundness changes:</strong> Fixes to holes uncovered in the type system.</li>
<li><strong>Compiler bugs:</strong> Places where the compiler is not implementing the specified
semantics found in an RFC or lang-team decision.</li>
<li><strong>Underspecified language semantics:</strong> Clarifications to grey areas where the
compiler behaves inconsistently and no formal behavior had been previously
decided.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please see <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1122-language-semver.md">the RFC</a> for full details!</p>
<h1 id="detailed-design"><a class="header" href="#detailed-design">Detailed design</a></h1>
<p>The procedure for making a breaking change is as follows (each of these steps is
described in more detail below):</p>
<ol>
<li>Do a <strong>crater run</strong> to assess the impact of the change.</li>
<li>Make a <strong>special tracking issue</strong> dedicated to the change.</li>
<li>Do not report an error right away. Instead, <strong>issue forwards-compatibility
lint warnings</strong>.
<ul>
<li>Sometimes this is not straightforward. See the text below for suggestions
on different techniques we have employed in the past.</li>
<li>For cases where warnings are infeasible:
<ul>
<li>Report errors, but make every effort to give a targeted error message
that directs users to the tracking issue</li>
<li>Submit PRs to all known affected crates that fix the issue
<ul>
<li>or, at minimum, alert the owners of those crates to the problem and
direct them to the tracking issue</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once the change has been in the wild for at least one cycle, we can
<strong>stabilize the change</strong>, converting those warnings into errors.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, for changes to <code>rustc_ast</code> that will affect plugins, the general policy
is to batch these changes. That is discussed below in more detail.</p>
<h3 id="tracking-issue"><a class="header" href="#tracking-issue">Tracking issue</a></h3>
<p>Every breaking change should be accompanied by a <strong>dedicated tracking issue</strong>
for that change. The main text of this issue should describe the change being
made, with a focus on what users must do to fix their code. The issue should be
approachable and practical; it may make sense to direct users to an RFC or some
other issue for the full details. The issue also serves as a place where users
can comment with questions or other concerns.</p>
<p>A template for these breaking-change tracking issues can be found below. An
example of how such an issue should look can be <a href="https://gist.github.com/nikomatsakis/631ec8b4af9a18b5d062d9d9b7d3d967">found
here</a>.</p>
<p>The issue should be tagged with (at least) <code>B-unstable</code> and <code>T-compiler</code>.</p>
<h3 id="tracking-issue-template"><a class="header" href="#tracking-issue-template">Tracking issue template</a></h3>
<p>This is a template to use for tracking issues:</p>
<pre><code>This is the **summary issue** for the `YOUR_LINT_NAME_HERE`
future-compatibility warning and other related errors. The goal of
this page is describe why this change was made and how you can fix
code that is affected by it. It also provides a place to ask questions
or register a complaint if you feel the change should not be made. For
more information on the policy around future-compatibility warnings,
see our [breaking change policy guidelines][guidelines].

[guidelines]: LINK_TO_THIS_RFC

#### What is the warning for?

*Describe the conditions that trigger the warning and how they can be
fixed. Also explain why the change was made.**

#### When will this warning become a hard error?

At the beginning of each 6-week release cycle, the Rust compiler team
will review the set of outstanding future compatibility warnings and
nominate some of them for **Final Comment Period**. Toward the end of
the cycle, we will review any comments and make a final determination
whether to convert the warning into a hard error or remove it
entirely.
</code></pre>
<h3 id="issuing-future-compatibility-warnings"><a class="header" href="#issuing-future-compatibility-warnings">Issuing future compatibility warnings</a></h3>
<p>The best way to handle a breaking change is to begin by issuing
future-compatibility warnings. These are a special category of lint warning.
Adding a new future-compatibility warning can be done as follows.</p>

<h4 id="helpful-techniques"><a class="header" href="#helpful-techniques">Helpful techniques</a></h4>
<p>It can often be challenging to filter out new warnings from older, pre-existing
errors. One technique that has been used in the past is to run the older code
unchanged and collect the errors it would have reported. You can then issue
warnings for any errors you would give which do not appear in that original set.
Another option is to abort compilation after the original code completes if
errors are reported: then you know that your new code will only execute when
there were no errors before.</p>
<h4 id="crater-and-cratesio"><a class="header" href="#crater-and-cratesio">Crater and crates.io</a></h4>
<p>We should always do a crater run to assess impact. It is polite and considerate
to at least notify the authors of affected crates the breaking change. If we can
submit PRs to fix the problem, so much the better.</p>
<h4 id="is-it-ever-acceptable-to-go-directly-to-issuing-errors"><a class="header" href="#is-it-ever-acceptable-to-go-directly-to-issuing-errors">Is it ever acceptable to go directly to issuing errors?</a></h4>
<p>Changes that are believed to have negligible impact can go directly to issuing
an error. One rule of thumb would be to check against <code>crates.io</code>: if fewer than
10 <strong>total</strong> affected projects are found (<strong>not</strong> root errors), we can move
straight to an error. In such cases, we should still make the &quot;breaking change&quot;
page as before, and we should ensure that the error directs users to this page.
In other words, everything should be the same except that users are getting an
error, and not a warning. Moreover, we should submit PRs to the affected
projects (ideally before the PR implementing the change lands in rustc).</p>
<p>If the impact is not believed to be negligible (e.g., more than 10 crates are
affected), then warnings are required (unless the compiler team agrees to grant
a special exemption in some particular case). If implementing warnings is not
feasible, then we should make an aggressive strategy of migrating crates before
we land the change so as to lower the number of affected crates. Here are some
techniques for approaching this scenario:</p>
<ol>
<li>Issue warnings for subparts of the problem, and reserve the new errors for
the smallest set of cases you can.</li>
<li>Try to give a very precise error message that suggests how to fix the problem
and directs users to the tracking issue.</li>
<li>It may also make sense to layer the fix:
<ul>
<li>First, add warnings where possible and let those land before proceeding to
issue errors.</li>
<li>Work with authors of affected crates to ensure that corrected versions are
available <em>before</em> the fix lands, so that downstream users can use them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="stabilization-1"><a class="header" href="#stabilization-1">Stabilization</a></h3>
<p>After a change is made, we will <strong>stabilize</strong> the change using the same process
that we use for unstable features:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>After a new release is made, we will go through the outstanding tracking
issues corresponding to breaking changes and nominate some of them for <strong>final
comment period</strong> (FCP).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The FCP for such issues lasts for one cycle. In the final week or two of the
cycle, we will review comments and make a final determination:</p>
<ul>
<li>Convert to error: the change should be made into a hard error.</li>
<li>Revert: we should remove the warning and continue to allow the older code to
compile.</li>
<li>Defer: can't decide yet, wait longer, or try other strategies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Ideally, breaking changes should have landed on the <strong>stable branch</strong> of the
compiler before they are finalized.</p>
<a name="guide">
<h3 id="removing-a-lint"><a class="header" href="#removing-a-lint">Removing a lint</a></h3>
<p>Once we have decided to make a &quot;future warning&quot; into a hard error, we need a PR
that removes the custom lint. As an example, here are the steps required to
remove the <code>overlapping_inherent_impls</code> compatibility lint. First, convert the
name of the lint to uppercase (<code>OVERLAPPING_INHERENT_IMPLS</code>) ripgrep through the
source for that string. We will basically by converting each place where this
lint name is mentioned (in the compiler, we use the upper-case name, and a macro
automatically generates the lower-case string; so searching for
<code>overlapping_inherent_impls</code> would not find much).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: these exact files don't exist anymore, but the procedure is still the same.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="remove-the-lint"><a class="header" href="#remove-the-lint">Remove the lint.</a></h4>
<p>The first reference you will likely find is the lint definition <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/085d71c3efe453863739c1fb68fd9bd1beff214f/src/librustc/lint/builtin.rs#L171-L175">in
<code>rustc_session/src/lint/builtin.rs</code> that resembles this</a>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>declare_lint! {
    pub OVERLAPPING_INHERENT_IMPLS,
    Deny, // this may also say Warning
    &quot;two overlapping inherent impls define an item with the same name were erroneously allowed&quot;
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>This <code>declare_lint!</code> macro creates the relevant data structures. Remove it. You
will also find that there is a mention of <code>OVERLAPPING_INHERENT_IMPLS</code> later in
the file as <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/085d71c3efe453863739c1fb68fd9bd1beff214f/src/librustc/lint/builtin.rs#L252-L290">part of a <code>lint_array!</code></a>; remove it too.</p>
<p>Next, you see <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/085d71c3efe453863739c1fb68fd9bd1beff214f/src/librustc_lint/lib.rs#L202-L205">a reference to <code>OVERLAPPING_INHERENT_IMPLS</code> in

},
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Remove this too.</p>
<h4 id="add-the-lint-to-the-list-of-removed-lists"><a class="header" href="#add-the-lint-to-the-list-of-removed-lists">Add the lint to the list of removed lists.</a></h4>
<p>In <code>compiler/rustc_lint/src/lib.rs</code> there is a list of &quot;renamed and removed lints&quot;.
You can add this lint to the list:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>store.register_removed(&quot;overlapping_inherent_impls&quot;, &quot;converted into hard error, see #36889&quot;);
<span class="boring">}

<p>where <code>#36889</code> is the tracking issue for your lint.</p>
<h4 id="update-the-places-that-issue-the-lint"><a class="header" href="#update-the-places-that-issue-the-lint">Update the places that issue the lint</a></h4>
<p>Finally, the last class of references you will see are the places that actually
<strong>trigger</strong> the lint itself (i.e., what causes the warnings to appear). These
you do not want to delete. Instead, you want to convert them into errors. In
this case, the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/085d71c3efe453863739c1fb68fd9bd1beff214f/src/librustc_typeck/coherence/inherent.rs#L300-L303"><code>add_lint</code> call</a> looks like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>self.tcx.sess.add_lint(lint::builtin::OVERLAPPING_INHERENT_IMPLS,
                       node_id,
                       self.tcx.span_of_impl(item1).unwrap(),
                       msg);
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>We want to convert this into an error. In some cases, there may be an
existing error for this scenario. In others, we will need to allocate a
fresh diagnostic code.  <a href="./diagnostics/diagnostic-codes.html">Instructions for allocating a fresh diagnostic
code can be found here.</a> You may want
to mention in the extended description that the compiler behavior
changed on this point, and include a reference to the tracking issue for
the change.</p>
<p>Let's say that we've adopted <code>E0592</code> as our code. Then we can change the
<code>add_lint()</code> call above to something like:</p>

<p>Finally, run the test suite. These should be some tests that used to reference
the <code>overlapping_inherent_impls</code> lint, those will need to be updated. In
general, if the test used to have <code>#[deny(overlapping_inherent_impls)]</code>, that
can just be removed.</p>

<p>When you want to implement a new significant feature in the compiler,
you need to go through this process to make sure everything goes
smoothly.</p>
<h2 id="the-rfcbot-fcp-process"><a class="header" href="#the-rfcbot-fcp-process">The @rfcbot FCP process</a></h2>
<p>When the change is small and uncontroversial, then it can be done
with just writing a PR and getting an r+ from someone who knows that
part of the code. However, if the change is potentially controversial,
it would be a bad idea to push it without consensus from the rest
of the team (both in the &quot;distributed system&quot; sense to make sure
you don't break anything you don't know about, and in the social
sense to avoid PR fights).</p>
<p>If such a change seems to be too small to require a full formal RFC process
(e.g., a small standard library addition, a big refactoring of the code, a
&quot;technically-breaking&quot; change, or a &quot;big bugfix&quot; that basically amounts to a
small feature) but is still too controversial or big to get by with a single r+,
you can propose a final comment period (FCP). Or, if you're not on the relevant
team (and thus don't have @rfcbot permissions), ask someone who is to start one;
unless they have a concern themselves, they should.</p>
<p>Again, the FCP process is only needed if you need consensus – if you
don't think anyone would have a problem with your change, it's OK to
get by with only an r+. For example, it is OK to add or modify
unstable command-line flags or attributes without an FCP for
compiler development or standard library use, as long as you don't
expect them to be in wide use in the nightly ecosystem.
Some teams have lighter weight processes that they use in scenarios
like this; for example, the compiler team recommends
filing a Major Change Proposal (<a href="compiler/mcp.html#public-facing-changes-require-rfcbot-fcp">MCP</a>) as a lightweight way to
garner support and feedback without requiring full consensus.</p>
<p>You don't need to have the implementation fully ready for r+ to propose an FCP,
but it is generally a good idea to have at least a proof
of concept so that people can see what you are talking about.</p>
<p>When an FCP is proposed, it requires all members of the team to sign off the
FCP. After they all do so, there's a 10-day-long &quot;final comment period&quot; (hence
the name) where everybody can comment, and if no concerns are raised, the
PR/issue gets FCP approval.</p>
<h2 id="the-logistics-of-writing-features"><a class="header" href="#the-logistics-of-writing-features">The logistics of writing features</a></h2>
<p>There are a few &quot;logistic&quot; hoops you might need to go through in
order to implement a feature in a working way.</p>
<h3 id="warning-cycles"><a class="header" href="#warning-cycles">Warning Cycles</a></h3>
<p>In some cases, a feature or bugfix might break some existing programs
in some edge cases. In that case, you might want to do a crater run
to assess the impact and possibly add a future-compatibility lint,
similar to those used for
<a href="diagnostics.html#edition-gated-lints">edition-gated lints</a>.</p>
<h3 id="stability"><a class="header" href="#stability">Stability</a></h3>
<p>We <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1122-language-semver.md">value the stability of Rust</a>. Code that works and runs on stable
should (mostly) not break. Because of that, we don't want to release
a feature to the world with only team consensus and code review -
we want to gain real-world experience on using that feature on nightly,
and we might want to change the feature based on that experience.</p>
<p>To allow for that, we must make sure users don't accidentally depend
on that new feature - otherwise, especially if experimentation takes
time or is delayed and the feature takes the trains to stable,
it would end up de facto stable and we'll not be able to make changes
in it without breaking people's code.</p>
<p>The way we do that is that we make sure all new features are feature
gated - they can't be used without enabling a feature gate
(<code>#[feature(foo)]</code>), which can't be done in a stable/beta compiler.
See the <a href="implementing_new_features.html#stability-in-code">stability in code</a> section for the technical details.</p>
<p>Eventually, after we gain enough experience using the feature,
make the necessary changes, and are satisfied, we expose it to
the world using the stabilization process described <a href="./stabilization_guide.html">here</a>.
Until then, the feature is not set in stone: every part of the
feature can be changed, or the feature might be completely
rewritten or removed. Features are not supposed to gain tenure
by being unstable and unchanged for a year.</p>
<h3 id="tracking-issues"><a class="header" href="#tracking-issues">Tracking Issues</a></h3>
<p>To keep track of the status of an unstable feature, the
experience we get while using it on nightly, and of the
concerns that block its stabilization, every feature-gate
needs a tracking issue.</p>
<p>General discussions about the feature should be done on
the tracking issue.</p>
<p>For features that have an RFC, you should use the RFC's
tracking issue for the feature.</p>
<p>For other features, you'll have to make a tracking issue
for that feature. The issue title should be &quot;Tracking issue
for YOUR FEATURE&quot;.</p>
<p>For tracking issues for features (as opposed to future-compat
warnings), I don't think the description has to contain
anything specific. Generally we put the list of items required
for stabilization in a checklist, e.g.,</p>
<pre><code class="language-txt">**Steps:**

- [ ] Implement the RFC. (CC @rust-lang/compiler -- can anyone write
      up mentoring instructions?)
- [ ] Adjust the documentation. ([See instructions on rustc-dev-guide.](stabilization_guide.md#documentation-prs))
- [ ] Stabilize the feature. ([See instructions on rustc-dev-guide.](stabilization_guide.md#stabilization-pr))
</code></pre>
<h2 id="stability-in-code"><a class="header" href="#stability-in-code">Stability in code</a></h2>
<p>The below steps needs to be followed in order to implement
a new unstable feature:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open a <a href="implementing_new_features.html#tracking-issue">tracking issue</a> -
if you have an RFC, you can use the tracking issue for the RFC.</p>
<p>The tracking issue should be labeled with at least <code>C-tracking-issue</code>.
For a language feature, a label <code>F-feature_name</code> should be added as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pick a name for the feature gate (for RFCs, use the name
in the RFC).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a feature gate declaration to <code>rustc_feature/src/active.rs</code> in the active
<code>declare_features</code> block, and add the feature gate keyword to
<code>rustc_span/src/symbol.rs</code>. See <a href="./feature-gates.html#adding-a-feature-gate">here</a> for detailed instructions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prevent usage of the new feature unless the feature gate is set.
You can check it in most places in the compiler using the
expression <code>tcx.features().$feature_name</code> (or
<code>sess.features_untracked().$feature_name</code> if the
tcx is unavailable)</p>
<p>If the feature gate is not set, you should either maintain
the pre-feature behavior or raise an error, depending on
what makes sense. Errors should generally use <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_session/parse/fn.feature_err.html"><code>rustc_session::parse::feature_err</code></a>.
For an example of adding an error, see <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/81015">#81015</a>.</p>
<p>For features introducing new syntax, pre-expansion gating should be used instead.
To do so, extend the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_session/parse/struct.GatedSpans.html"><code>GatedSpans</code></a> struct, add spans to it during parsing,
and then finally feature-gate all the spans in
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_ast_passes/feature_gate/fn.check_crate.html"><code>rustc_ast_passes::feature_gate::check_crate</code></a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a test to ensure the feature cannot be used without
a feature gate, by creating <code>feature-gate-$feature_name.rs</code>
and <code>feature-gate-$feature_name.stderr</code> files under the
directory where the other tests for your feature reside.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a section to the unstable book, in
<code>src/doc/unstable-book/src/language-features/$feature_name.md</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write a lot of tests for the new feature.
PRs without tests will not be accepted!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get your PR reviewed and land it. You have now successfully
implemented a feature in Rust!</p>

<p>This section is about the stability attributes and schemes that allow stable
APIs to use unstable APIs internally in the rustc standard library.</p>
<p>For instructions on stabilizing a language feature see <a href="./stabilization_guide.html">Stabilizing
Features</a>.</p>
<h2 id="unstable"><a class="header" href="#unstable">unstable</a></h2>
<p>The <code>#[unstable(feature = &quot;foo&quot;, issue = &quot;1234&quot;, reason = &quot;lorem ipsum&quot;)]</code>
attribute explicitly marks an item as unstable. Items that are marked as
&quot;unstable&quot; cannot be used without a corresponding <code>#![feature]</code> attribute on
the crate, even on a nightly compiler. This restriction only applies across
crate boundaries, unstable items may be used within the crate that defines
them.</p>
<p>The <code>issue</code> field specifies the associated GitHub <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues">issue number</a>. This field is
required and all unstable features should have an associated tracking issue. In
rare cases where there is no sensible value <code>issue = &quot;none&quot;</code> is used.</p>
<p>The <code>unstable</code> attribute infects all sub-items, where the attribute doesn't
have to be reapplied. So if you apply this to a module, all items in the module
will be unstable.</p>
<p>You can make specific sub-items stable by using the <code>#[stable]</code> attribute on
them. The stability scheme works similarly to how <code>pub</code> works. You can have
public functions of nonpublic modules and you can have stable functions in
unstable modules or vice versa.</p>
<p>Note, however, that due to a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/15702">rustc bug</a>, stable items inside unstable modules
<em>are</em> available to stable code in that location!  So, for example, stable code
can import <code>core::intrinsics::transmute</code> even though <code>intrinsics</code> is an
unstable module.  Thus, this kind of nesting should be avoided when possible.</p>
<p>The <code>unstable</code> attribute may also have the <code>soft</code> value, which makes it a
future-incompatible deny-by-default lint instead of a hard error. This is used
by the <code>bench</code> attribute which was accidentally accepted in the past. This
prevents breaking dependencies by leveraging Cargo's lint capping.</p>
<h2 id="stable"><a class="header" href="#stable">stable</a></h2>
<p>The <code>#[stable(feature = &quot;foo&quot;, since = &quot;1.420.69&quot;)]</code> attribute explicitly
marks an item as stabilized. Note that stable functions may use unstable things in their body.</p>
<h2 id="rustc_const_unstable"><a class="header" href="#rustc_const_unstable">rustc_const_unstable</a></h2>
<p>The <code>#[rustc_const_unstable(feature = &quot;foo&quot;, issue = &quot;1234&quot;, reason = &quot;lorem ipsum&quot;)]</code>
has the same interface as the <code>unstable</code> attribute. It is used to mark
<code>const fn</code> as having their constness be unstable. This allows you to make a
function stable without stabilizing its constness or even just marking an existing
stable function as <code>const fn</code> without instantly stabilizing the <code>const fn</code>ness.</p>
<p>Furthermore this attribute is needed to mark an intrinsic as <code>const fn</code>, because
there's no way to add <code>const</code> to functions in <code>extern</code> blocks for now.</p>
<h2 id="rustc_const_stable"><a class="header" href="#rustc_const_stable">rustc_const_stable</a></h2>
<p>The <code>#[rustc_const_stable(feature = &quot;foo&quot;, since = &quot;1.420.69&quot;)]</code> attribute explicitly marks
a <code>const fn</code> as having its constness be <code>stable</code>. This attribute can make sense
even on an <code>unstable</code> function, if that function is called from another
<code>rustc_const_stable</code> function.</p>
<p>Furthermore this attribute is needed to mark an intrinsic as callable from
<code>rustc_const_stable</code> functions.</p>
<h2 id="stabilizing-a-library-feature"><a class="header" href="#stabilizing-a-library-feature">Stabilizing a library feature</a></h2>
<p>To stabilize a feature, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ask a <strong>@T-libs-api</strong> member to start an FCP on the tracking issue and wait for
the FCP to complete (with <code>disposition-merge</code>).</li>
<li>Change <code>#[unstable(...)]</code> to <code>#[stable(since = &quot;CURRENT_RUSTC_VERSION&quot;)]</code>.</li>
<li>Remove <code>#![feature(...)]</code> from any test or doc-test for this API. If the feature is used in the
compiler or tools, remove it from there as well.</li>
<li>If applicable, change <code>#[rustc_const_unstable(...)]</code> to
<code>#[rustc_const_stable(since = &quot;CURRENT_RUSTC_VERSION&quot;)]</code>.</li>
<li>Open a PR against <code>rust-lang/rust</code>.
<ul>
<li>Add the appropriate labels: <code>@rustbot modify labels: +T-libs-api</code>.</li>
<li>Link to the tracking issue and say &quot;Closes #XXXXX&quot;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You can see an example of stabilizing a feature with
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/81656">tracking issue #81656 with FCP</a>
and the associated
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/84642">implementation PR #84642</a>.</p>
<h2 id="allow_internal_unstable"><a class="header" href="#allow_internal_unstable">allow_internal_unstable</a></h2>
<p>Macros and compiler desugarings expose their bodies to the call
site. To work around not being able to use unstable things in the standard
library's macros, there's the <code>#[allow_internal_unstable(feature1, feature2)]</code>
attribute that allows the given features to be used in stable macros.</p>
<h2 id="rustc_allow_const_fn_unstable"><a class="header" href="#rustc_allow_const_fn_unstable">rustc_allow_const_fn_unstable</a></h2>
<p><code>const fn</code>, while not directly exposing their body to the world, are going to get
evaluated at compile time in stable crates. If their body does something const-unstable,
that could lock us into certain features indefinitely by accident. Thus no unstable const
features are allowed inside stable <code>const fn</code>.</p>
<p>However, sometimes we do know that a feature will get
stabilized, just not when, or there is a stable (but e.g. runtime-slow) workaround, so we
could always fall back to some stable version if we scrapped the unstable feature.
In those cases, the rustc_allow_const_fn_unstable attribute can be used to allow some
unstable features in the body of a stable <code>const fn</code>.</p>
<p>You also need to take care to uphold the <code>const fn</code> invariant that calling it at runtime and
compile-time needs to behave the same (see also <a href="https://www.ralfj.de/blog/2018/07/19/const.html">this blog post</a>). This means that you
may not create a <code>const fn</code> that e.g. transmutes a memory address to an integer,
because the addresses of things are nondeterministic and often unknown at
compile-time.</p>
<p>Always ping @rust-lang/wg-const-eval if you are adding more
<code>rustc_allow_const_fn_unstable</code> attributes to any <code>const fn</code>.</p>
<h2 id="staged_api"><a class="header" href="#staged_api">staged_api</a></h2>
<p>Any crate that uses the <code>stable</code> or <code>unstable</code> attributes must include the
<code>#![feature(staged_api)]</code> attribute on the crate.</p>
<h2 id="deprecated"><a class="header" href="#deprecated">deprecated</a></h2>
<p>Deprecations in the standard library are nearly identical to deprecations in
user code. When <code>#[deprecated]</code> is used on an item, it must also have a <code>stable</code>
or <code>unstable </code>attribute.</p>
<p><code>deprecated</code> has the following form:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">#[deprecated(
    since = &quot;1.38.0&quot;,
    note = &quot;explanation for deprecation&quot;,
    suggestion = &quot;other_function&quot;
)]
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>suggestion</code> field is optional. If given, it should be a string that can be
used as a machine-applicable suggestion to correct the warning. This is
typically used when the identifier is renamed, but no other significant changes
are necessary. When the <code>suggestion</code> field is used, you need to have
<code>#![feature(deprecated_suggestion)]</code> at the crate root.</p>
<p>Another difference from user code is that the <code>since</code> field is actually checked
against the current version of <code>rustc</code>. If <code>since</code> is in a future version, then
the <code>deprecated_in_future</code> lint is triggered which is default <code>allow</code>, but most
of the standard library raises it to a warning with
<code>#![warn(deprecated_in_future)]</code>.</p>

<h3 id="updating-the-feature-gate-listing"><a class="header" href="#updating-the-feature-gate-listing">Updating the feature-gate listing</a></h3>
<p>There is a central listing of feature-gates in
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_feature/index.html"><code>compiler/rustc_feature</code></a>. Search for the <code>declare_features!</code>
macro. There should be an entry for the feature you are aiming
to stabilize, something like (this example is taken from
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/32409">rust-lang/rust#32409</a>:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>(Even though you will encounter version numbers in the file of past changes,
you should not put the rustc version you expect your stabilization to happen in,
but instead <code>CURRENT_RUSTC_VERSION</code>)</p>
<h3 id="removing-existing-uses-of-the-feature-gate"><a class="header" href="#removing-existing-uses-of-the-feature-gate">Removing existing uses of the feature-gate</a></h3>
<p>Next search for the feature string (in this case, <code>pub_restricted</code>)
in the codebase to find where it appears. Change uses of
<code>#![feature(XXX)]</code> from the <code>std</code> and any rustc crates (this includes test folders
under <code>library/</code> and <code>compiler/</code> but not the toplevel <code>test/</code> one) to be
<code>#![cfg_attr(bootstrap, feature(XXX))]</code>. This includes the feature-gate
only for stage0, which is built using the current beta (this is
needed because the feature is still unstable in the current beta).</p>
<p>Also, remove those strings from any tests. If there are tests
specifically targeting the feature-gate (i.e., testing that the
feature-gate is required to use the feature, but nothing else),
simply remove the test.</p>
<h3 id="do-not-require-the-feature-gate-to-use-the-feature"><a class="header" href="#do-not-require-the-feature-gate-to-use-the-feature">Do not require the feature-gate to use the feature</a></h3>
<p>Most importantly, remove the code which flags an error if the
feature-gate is not present (since the feature is now considered
stable). If the feature can be detected because it employs some
new syntax, then a common place for that code to be is in the
same <code>compiler/rustc_ast_passes/src/feature_gate.rs</code>.
For example, you might see code like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">gate_feature_post!(&amp;self, pub_restricted, span,
 &quot;`pub(restricted)` syntax is experimental&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>This <code>gate_feature_post!</code> macro prints an error if the
<code>pub_restricted</code> feature is not enabled. It is not needed
now that <code>#[pub_restricted]</code> is stable.</p>
<p>For more subtle features, you may find code like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">if self.tcx.sess.features.borrow().pub_restricted { /* XXX */ }
</code></pre>
<p>This <code>pub_restricted</code> field (obviously named after the feature)
would ordinarily be false if the feature flag is not present
and true if it is. So transform the code to assume that the field
is true. In this case, that would mean removing the <code>if</code> and
leaving just the <code>/* XXX */</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">if self.tcx.sess.features.borrow().pub_restricted { /* XXX */ }
becomes
/* XXX */

if self.tcx.sess.features.borrow().pub_restricted &amp;&amp; something { /* XXX */ }
 becomes
if something { /* XXX */ }

<p>This chapter is intended to provide basic help for adding, removing, and
modifying feature gates.</p>
<h2 id="adding-a-feature-gate"><a class="header" href="#adding-a-feature-gate">Adding a feature gate</a></h2>
<p>See <a href="./implementing_new_features.html#stability-in-code">&quot;Stability in code&quot;</a> for help with adding a new feature; this section just
covers how to add the feature gate <em>declaration</em>.</p>
<p>First, add the feature name to <code>rustc_span/src/symbol.rs</code> in the <code>Symbols {...}</code> block.</p>
<p>Then, add a feature gate declaration to <code>rustc_feature/src/active.rs</code> in the active
<code>declare_features</code> block:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">/// description of feature
(active, $feature_name, &quot;$current_nightly_version&quot;, Some($tracking_issue_number), $edition)
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>$edition</code> has the type <code>Option&lt;Edition&gt;</code>, and is typically
just <code>None</code>.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">/// Allows defining identifiers beyond ASCII.
(active, non_ascii_idents, &quot;1.0.0&quot;, Some(55467), None),
</code></pre>
<p>Features can be marked as incomplete, and trigger the warn-by-default <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/lints/listing/warn-by-default.html#incomplete-features"><code>incomplete_features</code> lint</a>
by setting their type to <code>incomplete</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">/// Allows unsized rvalues at arguments and parameters.
(incomplete, unsized_locals, &quot;1.30.0&quot;, Some(48055), None),
</code></pre>
<p>When added, the current version should be the one for the current nightly.
Once the feature is moved to <code>accepted.rs</code>, the version is changed to that
nightly version.</p>
<h2 id="removing-a-feature-gate"><a class="header" href="#removing-a-feature-gate">Removing a feature gate</a></h2>
<p>To remove a feature gate, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Remove the feature gate declaration in <code>rustc_feature/src/active.rs</code>.
It will look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">/// description of feature
(active, $feature_name, &quot;$version&quot;, Some($tracking_issue_number), $edition)
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a modified version of the feature gate declaration that you just
removed to <code>rustc_feature/src/removed.rs</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">/// description of feature
(removed, $old_feature_name, &quot;$version&quot;, Some($tracking_issue_number), $edition,
 Some(&quot;$why_it_was_removed&quot;))
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="renaming-a-feature-gate"><a class="header" href="#renaming-a-feature-gate">Renaming a feature gate</a></h2>
<p>To rename a feature gate, follow these steps (the first two are the same steps
to follow when <a href="feature-gates.html#removing-a-feature-gate">removing a feature gate</a>):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Remove the old feature gate declaration in <code>rustc_feature/src/active.rs</code>.
It will look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">/// description of feature
(active, $old_feature_name, &quot;$version&quot;, Some($tracking_issue_number), $edition)
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a modified version of the old feature gate declaration that you just
removed to <code>rustc_feature/src/removed.rs</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">/// description of feature
/// Renamed to `$new_feature_name`
(removed, $old_feature_name, &quot;$version&quot;, Some($tracking_issue_number), $edition,
 Some(&quot;renamed to `$new_feature_name`&quot;))
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a feature gate declaration with the new name to
<code>rustc_feature/src/active.rs</code>. It should look very similar to the old
declaration:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">/// description of feature
(active, $new_feature_name, &quot;$version&quot;, Some($tracking_issue_number), $edition)
</code></pre>
</li>

<h1 id="formatting-and-the-tidy-script"><a class="header" href="#formatting-and-the-tidy-script">Formatting and the tidy script</a></h1>
<p>rustc is moving towards the <a href="https://github.com/rust-dev-tools/fmt-rfcs">Rust standard coding style</a>.</p>
<p>However, for now we don't use stable <code>rustfmt</code>; we use a pinned version with a
special config, so this may result in different style from normal <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt"><code>rustfmt</code></a>.
Therefore, formatting this repository using <code>cargo fmt</code> is not recommended.</p>
<p>Instead, formatting should be done using <code>./x.py fmt</code>. It's a good habit to run
<code>./x.py fmt</code> before every commit, as this reduces conflicts later.</p>
<p>Formatting is checked by the <code>tidy</code> script. It runs automatically when you do
<code>./x.py test</code> and can be run in isolation with <code>./x.py fmt --check</code>.</p>
<p>If you want to use format-on-save in your editor, the pinned version of
<code>rustfmt</code> is built under <code>build/&lt;target&gt;/stage0/bin/rustfmt</code>. You'll have to
pass the <!-- date-check: nov 2022 --> <code>--edition=2021</code> argument yourself when calling
<code>rustfmt</code> directly.</p>

<h3 id="copyright-notice"><a class="header" href="#copyright-notice">Copyright notice</a></h3>
<p>In the past, files began with a copyright and license notice. Please <strong>omit</strong>
this notice for new files licensed under the standard terms (dual
MIT/Apache-2.0).</p>
<p>All of the copyright notices should be gone by now, but if you come across one
in the rust-lang/rust repo, feel free to open a PR to remove it.</p>
<h2 id="line-length"><a class="header" href="#line-length">Line length</a></h2>
<p>Lines should be at most 100 characters. It's even better if you can
keep things to 80.</p>
<p><strong>Ignoring the line length limit.</strong> Sometimes – in particular for
tests – it can be necessary to exempt yourself from this limit. In
that case, you can add a comment towards the top of the file like so:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]

<h1 id="coding-for-correctness"><a class="header" href="#coding-for-correctness">Coding for correctness</a></h1>
<p>Beyond formatting, there are a few other tips that are worth
following.</p>
<h2 id="prefer-exhaustive-matches"><a class="header" href="#prefer-exhaustive-matches">Prefer exhaustive matches</a></h2>
<p>Using <code>_</code> in a match is convenient, but it means that when new
variants are added to the enum, they may not get handled correctly.
Ask yourself: if a new variant were added to this enum, what's the
chance that it would want to use the <code>_</code> code, versus having some
other treatment?  Unless the answer is &quot;low&quot;, then prefer an
exhaustive match. (The same advice applies to <code>if let</code> and <code>while let</code>, which are effectively tests for a single variant.)</p>
<h2 id="use-todo-comments-for-things-you-dont-want-to-forget"><a class="header" href="#use-todo-comments-for-things-you-dont-want-to-forget">Use &quot;TODO&quot; comments for things you don't want to forget</a></h2>
<p>As a useful tool to yourself, you can insert a <code>// TODO</code> comment
for something that you want to get back to before you land your PR:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn do_something() {
    if something_else {
        unimplemented!(); // TODO write this
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The tidy script will report an error for a <code>// TODO</code> comment, so this
code would not be able to land until the TODO is fixed (or removed).</p>
<p>This can also be useful in a PR as a way to signal from one commit that you are
leaving a bug that a later commit will fix:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">if foo {
    return true; // TODO wrong, but will be fixed in a later commit
}
</code></pre>

<h1 id="how-to-structure-your-pr"><a class="header" href="#how-to-structure-your-pr">How to structure your PR</a></h1>
<p>How you prepare the commits in your PR can make a big difference for the
reviewer.  Here are some tips.</p>
<p><strong>Isolate &quot;pure refactorings&quot; into their own commit.</strong> For example, if
you rename a method, then put that rename into its own commit, along
with the renames of all the uses.</p>
<p><strong>More commits is usually better.</strong> If you are doing a large change,
it's almost always better to break it up into smaller steps that can
be independently understood. The one thing to be aware of is that if
you introduce some code following one strategy, then change it
dramatically (versus adding to it) in a later commit, that
'back-and-forth' can be confusing.</p>
<p><strong>Format liberally.</strong> While only the final commit of a PR must be correctly
formatted, it is both easier to review and less noisy to format each commit
individually using <code>./x.py fmt</code>.</p>
<p><strong>No merges.</strong> We do not allow merge commits into our history, other
than those by bors. If you get a merge conflict, rebase instead via a
command like <code>git rebase -i rust-lang/master</code> (presuming you use the
name <code>rust-lang</code> for your remote).</p>
<p><strong>Individual commits do not have to build (but it's nice).</strong> We do not
require that every intermediate commit successfully builds – we only
expect to be able to bisect at a PR level. However, if you <em>can</em> make
individual commits build, that is always helpful.</p>
<h1 id="naming-conventions"><a class="header" href="#naming-conventions">Naming conventions</a></h1>
<p>Apart from normal Rust style/naming conventions, there are also some specific
to the compiler.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>cx</code> tends to be short for &quot;context&quot; and is often used as a suffix. For
example, <code>tcx</code> is a common name for the <a href="./ty.html">Typing Context</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="./ty.html"><code>'tcx</code></a> is used as the lifetime name for the Typing Context.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because <code>crate</code> is a keyword, if you need a variable to represent something
crate-related, often the spelling is changed to <code>krate</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="notification-groups"><a class="header" href="#notification-groups">Notification groups</a></h1>
<p>The <strong>notification groups</strong> are an easy way to help out with rustc in a
&quot;piece-meal&quot; fashion, without committing to a larger project.
Notification groups are <strong><a href="notification-groups/about.html#join">easy to join</a></strong> (just submit a PR!)
and joining does not entail any particular commitment.</p>
<p>Once you <a href="notification-groups/about.html#join">join a notification group</a>, you will be added to
a list that receives pings on github whenever a new issue is found
that fits the notification group's criteria. If you are interested, you
can then <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/triagebot/wiki/Assignment">claim the issue</a> and start working on it.</p>
<p>Of course, you don't have to wait for new issues to be tagged! If you
prefer, you can use the Github label for a notification group to
search for existing issues that haven't been claimed yet.</p>
<h2 id="list-of-notification-groups"><a class="header" href="#list-of-notification-groups">List of notification groups</a></h2>
<p>Here's the list of the notification groups:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="notification-groups/./arm.html">ARM</a></li>
<li><a href="notification-groups/./cleanup-crew.html">Cleanup Crew</a></li>
<li><a href="notification-groups/./llvm.html">LLVM</a></li>

<p>Notification groups tend to get pinged on <strong>isolated</strong> bugs,
particularly those of <strong>middle priority</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>By <strong>isolated</strong>, we mean that we do not expect large-scale refactoring
to be required to fix the bug.</li>
<li>By <strong>middle priority</strong>, we mean that we'd like to see the bug fixed,
but it's not such a burning problem that we are dropping everything
else to fix it. The danger with such bugs, of course, is that they
can accumulate over time, and the role of the notification group is
to try and stop that from happening!</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="join"></a></p>
<h2 id="joining-a-notification-group"><a class="header" href="#joining-a-notification-group">Joining a notification group</a></h2>
<p>To join an notification group, you just have to open a PR adding your
Github username to the appropriate file in the Rust team repository.
See the &quot;example PRs&quot; below to get a precise idea and to identify the
file to edit.</p>
<p>Also, if you are not already a member of a Rust team then -- in addition
to adding your name to the file -- you have to checkout the repository and
run the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cargo run add-person $your_user_name

<h2 id="tagging-an-issue-for-a-notification-group"><a class="header" href="#tagging-an-issue-for-a-notification-group">Tagging an issue for a notification group</a></h2>
<p>To tag an issue as appropriate for a notification group, you give
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/triagebot/">rustbot</a> a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/triagebot/wiki/Pinging"><code>ping</code></a> command with the name of the notification
group. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">@rustbot ping llvm
@rustbot ping cleanup-crew
@rustbot ping windows
@rustbot ping arm
</code></pre>
<p>To make some commands shorter and easier to remember, there are aliases,
defined in the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/triagebot.toml"><code>triagebot.toml</code></a> file. For example, all of these commands
are equivalent and will ping the Cleanup Crew:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">@rustbot ping cleanup
@rustbot ping bisect
@rustbot ping reduce
</code></pre>
<p>Keep in mind that these aliases are meant to make humans' life easier.
They might be subject to change. If you need to ensure that a command
will always be valid, prefer the full invocations over the aliases.</p>
<p><strong>Note though that this should only be done by compiler team members
or contributors, and is typically done as part of compiler team
triage.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Github Label:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/ICEBreaker-Cleanup-Crew">ICEBreaker-Cleanup-Crew</a></p>
<p>The &quot;Cleanup Crew&quot; are focused on improving bug reports. Specifically,
the goal is to try to ensure that every bug report has all the
information that will be needed for someone to fix it:</p>
<ul>
<li>a minimal, standalone example that shows the problem</li>
<li>links to duplicates or related bugs</li>
<li>if the bug is a regression (something that used to work, but no longer does),
then a bisection to the PR or nightly that caused the regression</li>
</ul>
<p>This kind of cleanup is invaluable in getting bugs fixed. Better
still, it can be done by anybody who knows Rust, without any
particularly deep knowledge of the compiler.</p>
<p>Let's look a bit at the workflow for doing &quot;cleanup crew&quot; actions.</p>
<h2 id="finding-a-minimal-standalone-example"><a class="header" href="#finding-a-minimal-standalone-example">Finding a minimal, standalone example</a></h2>
<p>Here the ultimate goal is to produce an example that reproduces the same
problem but without relying on any external crates. Such a test ought to contain
as little code as possible, as well. This will make it much easier to isolate the problem.</p>
<p>However, even if the &quot;ultimate minimal test&quot; cannot be achieved, it's
still useful to post incremental minimizations. For example, if you
can eliminate some of the external dependencies, that is helpful, and
so forth. </p>
<p>It's particularly useful to reduce to an example that works
in the <a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/">Rust playground</a>, rather than
requiring people to checkout a cargo build.</p>
<p>There are many resources for how to produce minimized test cases. Here
are a few:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/jethrogb/rust-reduce">rust-reduce</a> tool can try to reduce
code automatically.
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://embed.cs.utah.edu/creduce/">C-reduce</a> tool also works
on Rust code, though it requires that you start from a single
file. (XXX link to some post explaining how to do it?)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>pnkfelix's <a href="http://blog.pnkfx.org/blog/2019/11/18/rust-bug-minimization-patterns/">Rust Bug Minimization Patterns</a> blog post
<ul>
<li>This post focuses on &quot;heavy bore&quot; techniques, where you are
starting with a large, complex cargo project that you wish to
narrow down to something standalone.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="links-to-duplicate-or-related-bugs"><a class="header" href="#links-to-duplicate-or-related-bugs">Links to duplicate or related bugs</a></h2>
<p>If you are on the &quot;Cleanup Crew&quot;, you will sometimes see multiple bug
reports that seem very similar. You can link one to the other just by
mentioning the other bug number in a Github comment. Sometimes it is
useful to close duplicate bugs. But if you do so, you should always
copy any test case from the bug you are closing to the other bug that
remains open, as sometimes duplicate-looking bugs will expose
different facets of the same problem.</p>
<h2 id="bisecting-regressions"><a class="header" href="#bisecting-regressions">Bisecting regressions</a></h2>
<p>For regressions (something that used to work, but no longer does), it
is super useful if we can figure out precisely when the code stopped
working.  The gold standard is to be able to identify the precise
<strong>PR</strong> that broke the code, so we can ping the author, but even
narrowing it down to a nightly build is helpful, especially as that
then gives us a range of PRs. (One other challenge is that we
sometimes land &quot;rollup&quot; PRs, which combine multiple PRs into one.)</p>
<h3 id="cargo-bisect-rustc"><a class="header" href="#cargo-bisect-rustc">cargo-bisect-rustc</a></h3>
<p>To help in figuring out the cause of a regression we have a tool
called <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/">cargo-bisect-rustc</a>. It will automatically download and test
various builds of rustc. For recent regressions, it is even able to
use the builds from our CI to track down the regression to a specific
PR; for older regressions, it will simply identify a nightly.</p>
<p>To learn to use <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo-bisect-rustc/">cargo-bisect-rustc</a>, check out <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2019/12/18/bisecting-rust-compiler.html">this blog
post</a>, which gives a quick introduction to how it works. You
can also ask questions at the Zulip stream
<a href="https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/217417-t-compiler.2Fcargo-bisect-rustc"><code>#t-compiler/cargo-bisect-rustc</code></a>, or help in improving the tool.</p>
<h3 id="identifying-the-range-of-prs-in-a-nightly"><a class="header" href="#identifying-the-range-of-prs-in-a-nightly">identifying the range of PRs in a nightly</a></h3>
<p>If the regression occurred more than 90 days ago, then
cargo-bisect-rustc will not able to identify the particular PR that
caused the regression, just the nightly build. In that case, we can
identify the set of PRs that this corresponds to by using the git
history. </p>
<p>The command <code>rustc +nightly -vV</code> will cause rustc to output a number
of useful bits of version info, including the <code>commit-hash</code>. Given the
commit-hash of two nightly versions, you can find all of PRs that have
landed in between by taking the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to an update checkout of the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/">rust-lang/rust</a> repository</li>
<li>Execute the command <code>git log --author=bors --format=oneline SHA1..SHA2</code></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>This will list out all of the commits by bors, which is our merge bot</li>
<li>Each commit corresponds to one PR, and information about the PR should be in the description</li>

<p><strong>Github Label:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels/A-LLVM">A-LLVM</a></p>
<p>The &quot;LLVM Notification Group&quot; are focused on bugs that center around LLVM.
These bugs often arise because of LLVM optimizations gone awry, or as
the result of an LLVM upgrade. The goal here is:</p>
<ul>
<li>to determine whether the bug is a result of us generating invalid LLVM IR,
or LLVM misoptimizing;</li>
<li>if the former, to fix our IR;</li>
<li>if the latter, to try and file a bug on LLVM (or identify an existing bug).</li>
</ul>
<p>The group may also be asked to weigh in on other sorts of LLVM-focused
questions.</p>
<h2 id="helpful-tips-and-options"><a class="header" href="#helpful-tips-and-options">Helpful tips and options</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="notification-groups/../backend/debugging.html">&quot;Debugging LLVM&quot;</a> section of the
rustc-dev-guide gives a step-by-step process for how to help debug bugs
caused by LLVM. In particular, it discusses how to emit LLVM IR, run
the LLVM IR optimization pipelines, and so forth. You may also find
it useful to look at the various codegen options listed under <code>-C help</code>
and the internal options under <code>-Z help</code> -- there are a number that
pertain to LLVM (just search for LLVM).</p>

<p>The remaining parts of this guide discuss how the compiler works. They go
through everything from high-level structure of the compiler to how each stage
of compilation works. They should be friendly to both readers interested in the
end-to-end process of compilation <em>and</em> readers interested in learning about a
specific system they wish to contribute to. If anything is unclear, feel free
to file an issue on the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-dev-guide/issues">rustc-dev-guide

team, as detailed in <a href="./compiler-team.html">this chapter from Part 1</a>.</p>
<p>In this part, we will look at the high-level architecture of the compiler. In
particular, we will look at three overarching design choices that impact the
whole compiler: the query system, incremental compilation, and interning.</p>

<p>This chapter is about the overall process of compiling a program -- how
everything fits together.</p>
<p>The Rust compiler is special in two ways: it does things to your code that
other compilers don't do (e.g. borrow checking) and it has a lot of
unconventional implementation choices (e.g. queries). We will talk about these
in turn in this chapter, and in the rest of the guide, we will look at all the
individual pieces in more detail.</p>
<h2 id="what-the-compiler-does-to-your-code"><a class="header" href="#what-the-compiler-does-to-your-code">What the compiler does to your code</a></h2>
<p>So first, let's look at what the compiler does to your code. For now, we will
avoid mentioning how the compiler implements these steps except as needed;
we'll talk about that later.</p>
<h3 id="invocation"><a class="header" href="#invocation">Invocation</a></h3>
<p>Compilation begins when a user writes a Rust source program in text
and invokes the <code>rustc</code> compiler on it. The work that the compiler needs to
perform is defined by command-line options. For example, it is possible to
enable nightly features (<code>-Z</code> flags), perform <code>check</code>-only builds, or emit
LLVM-IR rather than executable machine code. The <code>rustc</code> executable call may
be indirect through the use of <code>cargo</code>.</p>
<p>Command line argument parsing occurs in the <a href="rustc-driver.html"><code>rustc_driver</code></a>. This crate
defines the compile configuration that is requested by the user and passes it
to the rest of the compilation process as a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_interface/interface/struct.Config.html"><code>rustc_interface::Config</code></a>.</p>
<h3 id="lexing-and-parsing"><a class="header" href="#lexing-and-parsing">Lexing and parsing</a></h3>
<p>The raw Rust source text is analyzed by a low-level <em>lexer</em> located in
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_lexer/index.html"><code>rustc_lexer</code></a>. At this stage, the source text is turned into a stream of
atomic source code units known as <em>tokens</em>.  The lexer supports the
Unicode character encoding.</p>
<p>The token stream passes through a higher-level lexer located in
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_parse/index.html"><code>rustc_parse</code></a> to prepare for the next stage of the compile process. The
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_parse/lexer/struct.StringReader.html"><code>StringReader</code></a> struct is used at this stage to perform a set of validations
and turn strings into interned symbols (<em>interning</em> is discussed later).
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_interning">String interning</a> is a way of storing only one immutable
copy of each distinct string value.</p>
<p>The lexer has a small interface and doesn't depend directly on the
diagnostic infrastructure in <code>rustc</code>. Instead it provides diagnostics as plain
data which are emitted in <code>rustc_parse::lexer</code> as real diagnostics.
The lexer preserves full fidelity information for both IDEs and proc macros.</p>
<p>The <em>parser</em> <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_parse/index.html">translates the token stream from the lexer into an Abstract Syntax
Tree (AST)</a>. It uses a recursive descent (top-down) approach to syntax
analysis. The crate entry points for the parser are the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_parse/parser/struct.Parser.html#method.parse_crate_mod"><code>Parser::parse_crate_mod()</code></a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_parse/parser/struct.Parser.html#method.parse_mod"><code>Parser::parse_mod()</code></a>
methods found in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_parse/parser/struct.Parser.html"><code>rustc_parse::parser::Parser</code></a>. The external module parsing
entry point is <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_expand/module/fn.parse_external_mod.html"><code>rustc_expand::module::parse_external_mod</code></a>.
And the macro parser entry point is <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_parse/parser/struct.Parser.html#method.parse_nonterminal"><code>Parser::parse_nonterminal()</code></a>.</p>
<p>Parsing is performed with a set of <code>Parser</code> utility methods including <code>bump</code>,
<code>check</code>, <code>eat</code>, <code>expect</code>, <code>look_ahead</code>.</p>
<p>Parsing is organized by semantic construct. Separate
<code>parse_*</code> methods can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/compiler/rustc_parse/src/parser"><code>rustc_parse</code></a>
directory. The source file name follows the construct name. For example, the
following files are found in the parser:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>expr.rs</code></li>
<li><code>pat.rs</code></li>
<li><code>ty.rs</code></li>
<li><code>stmt.rs</code></li>
</ul>
<p>This naming scheme is used across many compiler stages. You will find
either a file or directory with the same name across the parsing, lowering,
type checking, THIR lowering, and MIR building sources.</p>
<p>Macro expansion, AST validation, name resolution, and early linting also take place
during this stage.</p>
<p>The parser uses the standard <code>DiagnosticBuilder</code> API for error handling, but we
try to recover, parsing a superset of Rust's grammar, while also emitting an error.
<code>rustc_ast::ast::{Crate, Mod, Expr, Pat, ...}</code> AST nodes are returned from the parser.</p>
<h3 id="hir-lowering"><a class="header" href="#hir-lowering">HIR lowering</a></h3>
<p>Next, we take the AST and convert it to <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_hir/index.html">High-Level Intermediate
Representation (HIR)</a>, a more compiler-friendly representation of the
AST. This process is called &quot;lowering&quot;. It involves a lot of desugaring of things
like loops and <code>async fn</code>.</p>
<p>We then use the HIR to do <a href="type-inference.html"><em>type inference</em></a> (the process of automatic
detection of the type of an expression), <a href="traits/resolution.html"><em>trait solving</em></a> (the process
of pairing up an impl with each reference to a trait), and <a href="type-checking.html"><em>type
checking</em></a>. Type checking is the process of converting the types found in the HIR
(<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_hir/hir/struct.Ty.html"><code>hir::Ty</code></a>), which represent what the user wrote,
into the internal representation used by the compiler (<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/struct.Ty.html"><code>Ty&lt;'tcx&gt;</code></a>).
That information is used to verify the type safety, correctness and
coherence of the types used in the program.</p>
<h3 id="mir-lowering"><a class="header" href="#mir-lowering">MIR lowering</a></h3>
<p>The HIR is then <a href="mir/index.html">lowered to Mid-level Intermediate Representation (MIR)</a>,
which is used for <a href="borrow_check.html">borrow checking</a>.</p>
<p>Along the way, we also construct the THIR, which is an even more desugared HIR.
THIR is used for pattern and exhaustiveness checking. It is also more
convenient to convert into MIR than HIR is.</p>
<p>We do <a href="mir/optimizations.html">many optimizations on the MIR</a> because it is still
generic and that improves the code we generate later, improving compilation
speed too.
MIR is a higher level (and generic) representation, so it is easier to do
some optimizations at MIR level than at LLVM-IR level. For example LLVM
doesn't seem to be able to optimize the pattern the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/66282"><code>simplify_try</code></a> mir
opt looks for.</p>
<p>Rust code is <em>monomorphized</em>, which means making copies of all the generic
code with the type parameters replaced by concrete types. To do
this, we need to collect a list of what concrete types to generate code for.
This is called <em>monomorphization collection</em> and it happens at the MIR level.</p>
<h3 id="code-generation"><a class="header" href="#code-generation">Code generation</a></h3>
<p>We then begin what is vaguely called <em>code generation</em> or <em>codegen</em>.
The <a href="backend/codegen.html">code generation stage</a> is when higher level
representations of source are turned into an executable binary. <code>rustc</code>
uses LLVM for code generation. The first step is to convert the MIR
to LLVM Intermediate Representation (LLVM IR). This is where the MIR
is actually monomorphized, according to the list we created in the
previous step.
The LLVM IR is passed to LLVM, which does a lot more optimizations on it.
It then emits machine code. It is basically assembly code with additional
low-level types and annotations added (e.g. an ELF object or WASM).
The different libraries/binaries are then linked together to produce the final
binary.</p>
<h2 id="how-it-does-it"><a class="header" href="#how-it-does-it">How it does it</a></h2>
<p>Ok, so now that we have a high-level view of what the compiler does to your
code, let's take a high-level view of <em>how</em> it does all that stuff. There are a
lot of constraints and conflicting goals that the compiler needs to
satisfy/optimize for. For example,</p>
<ul>
<li>Compilation speed: how fast is it to compile a program. More/better
compile-time analyses often means compilation is slower.
<ul>
<li>Also, we want to support incremental compilation, so we need to take that
into account. How can we keep track of what work needs to be redone and
what can be reused if the user modifies their program?
<ul>
<li>Also we can't store too much stuff in the incremental cache because
it would take a long time to load from disk and it could take a lot
of space on the user's system...</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Compiler memory usage: while compiling a program, we don't want to use more
memory than we need.</li>
<li>Program speed: how fast is your compiled program? More/better compile-time
analyses often means the compiler can do better optimizations.</li>
<li>Program size: how large is the compiled binary? Similar to the previous
point.</li>
<li>Compiler compilation speed: how long does it take to compile the compiler?
This impacts contributors and compiler maintenance.</li>
<li>Implementation complexity: building a compiler is one of the hardest
things a person/group can do, and Rust is not a very simple language, so how
do we make the compiler's code base manageable?</li>
<li>Compiler correctness: the binaries produced by the compiler should do what
the input programs says they do, and should continue to do so despite the
tremendous amount of change constantly going on.</li>
<li>Integration: a number of other tools need to use the compiler in
various ways (e.g. cargo, clippy, miri) that must be supported.</li>
<li>Compiler stability: the compiler should not crash or fail ungracefully on the
stable channel.</li>
<li>Rust stability: the compiler must respect Rust's stability guarantees by not
breaking programs that previously compiled despite the many changes that are
always going on to its implementation.</li>
<li>Limitations of other tools: rustc uses LLVM in its backend, and LLVM has some
strengths we leverage and some limitations/weaknesses we need to work around.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, as you read through the rest of the guide, keep these things in mind. They
will often inform decisions that we make.</p>
<h3 id="intermediate-representations"><a class="header" href="#intermediate-representations">Intermediate representations</a></h3>
<p>As with most compilers, <code>rustc</code> uses some intermediate representations (IRs) to
facilitate computations. In general, working directly with the source code is
extremely inconvenient and error-prone. Source code is designed to be human-friendly while at
the same time being unambiguous, but it's less convenient for doing something
like, say, type checking.</p>
<p>Instead most compilers, including <code>rustc</code>, build some sort of IR out of the
source code which is easier to analyze. <code>rustc</code> has a few IRs, each optimized
for different purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Token stream: the lexer produces a stream of tokens directly from the source
code. This stream of tokens is easier for the parser to deal with than raw
text.</li>
<li>Abstract Syntax Tree (AST): the abstract syntax tree is built from the stream
of tokens produced by the lexer. It represents
pretty much exactly what the user wrote. It helps to do some syntactic sanity
checking (e.g. checking that a type is expected where the user wrote one).</li>
<li>High-level IR (HIR): This is a sort of desugared AST. It's still close
to what the user wrote syntactically, but it includes some implicit things
such as some elided lifetimes, etc. This IR is amenable to type checking.</li>
<li>Typed HIR (THIR): This is an intermediate between HIR and MIR, and used to be called
High-level Abstract IR (HAIR). It is like the HIR but it is fully typed and a bit
more desugared (e.g. method calls and implicit dereferences are made fully explicit).
Moreover, it is easier to lower to MIR from THIR than from HIR.</li>
<li>Middle-level IR (MIR): This IR is basically a Control-Flow Graph (CFG). A CFG
is a type of diagram that shows the basic blocks of a program and how control
flow can go between them. Likewise, MIR also has a bunch of basic blocks with
simple typed statements inside them (e.g. assignment, simple computations,
etc) and control flow edges to other basic blocks (e.g., calls, dropping
values). MIR is used for borrow checking and other
important dataflow-based checks, such as checking for uninitialized values.
It is also used for a series of optimizations and for constant evaluation (via
MIRI). Because MIR is still generic, we can do a lot of analyses here more
efficiently than after monomorphization.</li>
<li>LLVM IR: This is the standard form of all input to the LLVM compiler. LLVM IR
is a sort of typed assembly language with lots of annotations. It's
a standard format that is used by all compilers that use LLVM (e.g. the clang
C compiler also outputs LLVM IR). LLVM IR is designed to be easy for other
compilers to emit and also rich enough for LLVM to run a bunch of
optimizations on it.</li>
</ul>
<p>One other thing to note is that many values in the compiler are <em>interned</em>.
This is a performance and memory optimization in which we allocate the values
in a special allocator called an <em>arena</em>. Then, we pass around references to
the values allocated in the arena. This allows us to make sure that identical
values (e.g. types in your program) are only allocated once and can be compared
cheaply by comparing pointers. Many of the intermediate representations are
interned.</p>
<h3 id="queries"><a class="header" href="#queries">Queries</a></h3>
<p>The first big implementation choice is the <em>query</em> system. The Rust compiler
uses a query system which is unlike most textbook compilers, which are
organized as a series of passes over the code that execute sequentially. The
compiler does this to make incremental compilation possible -- that is, if the
user makes a change to their program and recompiles, we want to do as little
redundant work as possible to produce the new binary.</p>
<p>In <code>rustc</code>, all the major steps above are organized as a bunch of queries that
call each other. For example, there is a query to ask for the type of something
and another to ask for the optimized MIR of a function. These
queries can call each other and are all tracked through the query system.
The results of the queries are cached on disk so that we can tell which
queries' results changed from the last compilation and only redo those. This is
how incremental compilation works.</p>
<p>In principle, for the query-fied steps, we do each of the above for each item
individually. For example, we will take the HIR for a function and use queries
to ask for the LLVM IR for that HIR. This drives the generation of optimized
MIR, which drives the borrow checker, which drives the generation of MIR, and
so on.</p>
<p>... except that this is very over-simplified. In fact, some queries are not
cached on disk, and some parts of the compiler have to run for all code anyway
for correctness even if the code is dead code (e.g. the borrow checker). For
example, <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/45ebd5808afd3df7ba842797c0fcd4447ddf30fb/src/librustc_interface/passes.rs#L824">currently the <code>mir_borrowck</code> query is first executed on all functions
of a crate.</a> Then the codegen backend invokes the
<code>collect_and_partition_mono_items</code> query, which first recursively requests the
<code>optimized_mir</code> for all reachable functions, which in turn runs <code>mir_borrowck</code>
for that function and then creates codegen units. This kind of split will need
to remain to ensure that unreachable functions still have their errors emitted.</p>
<p>Moreover, the compiler wasn't originally built to use a query system; the query
system has been retrofitted into the compiler, so parts of it are not query-fied
yet. Also, LLVM isn't our code, so that isn't querified either. The plan is to
eventually query-fy all of the steps listed in the previous section,
but as of <!-- date-check --> November 2022, only the steps between HIR and
LLVM IR are query-fied. That is, lexing, parsing, name resolution, and macro
expansion are done all at once for the whole program.</p>
<p>One other thing to mention here is the all-important &quot;typing context&quot;,
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/struct.TyCtxt.html"><code>TyCtxt</code></a>, which is a giant struct that is at the center of all things.
(Note that the name is mostly historic. This is <em>not</em> a &quot;typing context&quot; in the
sense of <code>Γ</code> or <code>Δ</code> from type theory. The name is retained because that's what
the name of the struct is in the source code.) All
queries are defined as methods on the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/struct.TyCtxt.html"><code>TyCtxt</code></a> type, and the in-memory query
cache is stored there too. In the code, there is usually a variable called
<code>tcx</code> which is a handle on the typing context. You will also see lifetimes with
the name <code>'tcx</code>, which means that something is tied to the lifetime of the
<code>TyCtxt</code> (usually it is stored or interned there).</p>
<h3 id="tyty"><a class="header" href="#tyty"><code>ty::Ty</code></a></h3>
<p>Types are really important in Rust, and they form the core of a lot of compiler
analyses. The main type (in the compiler) that represents types (in the user's
program) is <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/struct.Ty.html"><code>rustc_middle::ty::Ty</code></a>. This is so important that we have a whole chapter
on <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/struct.Ty.html"><code>ty::Ty</code></a>, but for now, we just want to mention that it exists and is the way
<code>rustc</code> represents types!</p>
<p>Also note that the <code>rustc_middle::ty</code> module defines the <code>TyCtxt</code> struct we mentioned before.</p>
<h3 id="parallelism"><a class="header" href="#parallelism">Parallelism</a></h3>
<p>Compiler performance is a problem that we would like to improve on
(and are always working on). One aspect of that is parallelizing
<code>rustc</code> itself.</p>
<p>Currently, there is only one part of rustc that is parallel by default: codegen.</p>
<p>However, the rest of the compiler is still not yet parallel. There have been
lots of efforts spent on this, but it is generally a hard problem. The current
approach is to turn <code>RefCell</code>s into <code>Mutex</code>s -- that is, we
switch to thread-safe internal mutability. However, there are ongoing
challenges with lock contention, maintaining query-system invariants under
concurrency, and the complexity of the code base. One can try out the current
work by enabling parallel compilation in <code>config.toml</code>. It's still early days,
but there are already some promising performance improvements.</p>
<h3 id="bootstrapping"><a class="header" href="#bootstrapping">Bootstrapping</a></h3>
<p><code>rustc</code> itself is written in Rust. So how do we compile the compiler? We use an
older compiler to compile the newer compiler. This is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(compilers)"><em>bootstrapping</em></a>.</p>
<p>Bootstrapping has a lot of interesting implications. For example, it means
that one of the major users of Rust is the Rust compiler, so we are
constantly testing our own software (&quot;eating our own dogfood&quot;).</p>

# Unresolved Questions

- Does LLVM ever do optimizations in debug builds?
- How do I explore phases of the compile process in my own sources (lexer,
  parser, HIR, etc)? - e.g., `cargo rustc -- -Z unpretty=hir-tree` allows you to
  view HIR representation
- What is the main source entry point for `X`?
- Where do phases diverge for cross-compilation to machine code across
  different platforms?

<p>Now that we have <a href="./overview.html">seen what the compiler does</a>, let's take a
look at the structure of the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust"><code>rust-lang/rust</code></a> repository, where the rustc
source code lives.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You may find it helpful to read the <a href="./overview.html">&quot;Overview of the compiler&quot;</a>
chapter, which introduces how the compiler works, before this one.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="workspace-structure"><a class="header" href="#workspace-structure">Workspace structure</a></h2>
<p>The <code>rust-lang/rust</code> repository consists of a single large cargo workspace
containing the compiler, the standard libraries (<code>core</code>, <code>alloc</code>, <code>std</code>,
<code>proc_macro</code>, etc), and <code>rustdoc</code>, along with the build system and a bunch of
tools and submodules for building a full Rust distribution.</p>
<p>The repository consists of three main directories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>compiler/</code> contains the source code for <code>rustc</code>. It consists of many crates
that together make up the compiler.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>library/</code> contains the standard libraries (<code>core</code>, <code>alloc</code>, <code>std</code>,
<code>proc_macro</code>, <code>test</code>), as well as the Rust runtime (<code>backtrace</code>, <code>rtstartup</code>,
<code>lang_start</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>tests/</code> contains the compiler tests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>src/</code> contains the source code for rustdoc, clippy, cargo, the build system,
language docs, etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="compiler"><a class="header" href="#compiler">Compiler</a></h2>
<p>The compiler is implemented in the various <code>compiler/</code> crates.
The <code>compiler/</code> crates all have names starting with <code>rustc_*</code>. These are a
collection of around 50 interdependent crates ranging in size from tiny to
huge. There is also the <code>rustc</code> crate which is the actual binary (i.e. the
<code>main</code> function); it doesn't actually do anything besides calling the
<code>rustc_driver</code> crate, which drives the various parts of compilation in other
crates.</p>
<p>The dependency structure of these crates is complex, but roughly it is
something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>rustc</code> (the binary) calls <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_driver/fn.main.html"><code>rustc_driver::main</code></a>.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_driver/index.html"><code>rustc_driver</code></a> depends on a lot of other crates, but the main one is
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_interface/index.html"><code>rustc_interface</code></a>.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_interface/index.html"><code>rustc_interface</code></a> depends on most of the other compiler crates. It
is a fairly generic interface for driving the whole compilation.
<ul>
<li>Most of the other <code>rustc_*</code> crates depend on <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/index.html"><code>rustc_middle</code></a>,
which defines a lot of central data structures in the compiler.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/index.html"><code>rustc_middle</code></a> and most of the other crates depend on a
handful of crates representing the early parts of the
compiler (e.g. the parser), fundamental data structures (e.g.
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_span/struct.Span.html"><code>Span</code></a>), or error reporting: <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_data_structures/index.html"><code>rustc_data_structures</code></a>,
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_span/index.html"><code>rustc_span</code></a>, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_errors/index.html"><code>rustc_errors</code></a>, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see the exact dependencies by reading the <code>Cargo.toml</code> for the various
crates, just like a normal Rust crate.</p>
<p>One final thing: <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/"><code>src/llvm-project</code></a> is a submodule for our fork of LLVM.
During bootstrapping, LLVM is built and the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/compiler/rustc_llvm"><code>compiler/rustc_llvm</code></a> crate
contains Rust wrappers around LLVM (which is written in C++), so that the
compiler can interface with it.</p>
<p>Most of this book is about the compiler, so we won't have any further
explanation of these crates here.</p>
<h3 id="big-picture"><a class="header" href="#big-picture">Big picture</a></h3>
<p>The dependency structure is influenced by two main factors:</p>
<ol>
<li>Organization. The compiler is a <em>huge</em> codebase; it would be an impossibly
large crate. In part, the dependency structure reflects the code structure
of the compiler.</li>
<li>Compile time. By breaking the compiler into multiple crates, we can take
better advantage of incremental/parallel compilation using cargo. In
particular, we try to have as few dependencies between crates as possible so
that we don't have to rebuild as many crates if you change one.</li>
</ol>
<p>At the very bottom of the dependency tree are a handful of crates that are used
by the whole compiler (e.g. <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_span/index.html"><code>rustc_span</code></a>). The very early parts of the
compilation process (e.g. parsing and the AST) depend on only these.</p>
<p>After the AST is constructed and other early analysis is done, the compiler's <a href="./query.html">query system</a>
gets set up. The query system is set up in a clever way using function
pointers. This allows us to break dependencies between crates, allowing more
parallel compilation.
The query system is defined in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/index.html"><code>rustc_middle</code></a>, so nearly all
subsequent parts of the compiler depend on this crate. It is a really large
crate, leading to long compile times. Some efforts have been made to move stuff
out of it with limited success. Another unfortunate side effect is that sometimes
related functionality gets scattered across different crates. For example,
linting functionality is scattered across earlier parts of the crate,
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_lint/index.html"><code>rustc_lint</code></a>, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/index.html"><code>rustc_middle</code></a>, and other places.</p>
<p>Ideally there would be fewer, more
cohesive crates, with incremental and parallel compilation making sure compile
times stay reasonable. However, our incremental and parallel compilation haven't
gotten good enough for that yet, so breaking things into separate crates has
been our solution so far.</p>
<p>At the top of the dependency tree are the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_interface/index.html"><code>rustc_interface</code></a> and
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_driver/index.html"><code>rustc_driver</code></a> crates. <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_interface/index.html"><code>rustc_interface</code></a> is an unstable wrapper around the
query system that helps to drive the various stages of compilation. Other
consumers of the compiler may use this interface in different ways (e.g.
rustdoc or maybe eventually rust-analyzer). The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_driver/index.html"><code>rustc_driver</code></a> crate first
parses command line arguments and then uses <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_interface/index.html"><code>rustc_interface</code></a> to drive the
compilation to completion.</p>
<h2 id="rustdoc"><a class="header" href="#rustdoc">rustdoc</a></h2>
<p>The bulk of <code>rustdoc</code> is in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustdoc/index.html"><code>librustdoc</code></a>. However, the <code>rustdoc</code> binary
itself is <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/tools/rustdoc"><code>src/tools/rustdoc</code></a>, which does nothing except call <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustdoc/fn.main.html"><code>rustdoc::main</code></a>.</p>
<p>There is also javascript and CSS for the rustdocs in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/tools/rustdoc-js"><code>src/tools/rustdoc-js</code></a>
and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/tools/rustdoc-themes"><code>src/tools/rustdoc-themes</code></a>.</p>
<p>You can read more about rustdoc in <a href="./rustdoc.html">this chapter</a>.</p>
<h2 id="tests-1"><a class="header" href="#tests-1">Tests</a></h2>
<p>The test suite for all of the above is in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/tests"><code>tests/</code></a>. You can read more
about the test suite <a href="./tests/intro.html">in this chapter</a>.</p>
<p>The test harness itself is in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/tools/compiletest"><code>src/tools/compiletest</code></a>.</p>
<h2 id="build-system"><a class="header" href="#build-system">Build System</a></h2>
<p>There are a number of tools in the repository just for building the compiler,
standard library, rustdoc, etc, along with testing, building a full Rust
distribution, etc.</p>
<p>One of the primary tools is <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/bootstrap"><code>src/bootstrap</code></a>. You can read more about
bootstrapping <a href="./building/bootstrapping.html">in this chapter</a>. The process may also use other tools
from <code>src/tools/</code>, such as <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/tools/tidy"><code>tidy</code></a> or <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/tools/compiletest"><code>compiletest</code></a>.</p>
<h2 id="standard-library"><a class="header" href="#standard-library">Standard library</a></h2>
<p>The standard library crates are all in <code>library/</code>. They have intuitive names
like <code>std</code>, <code>core</code>, <code>alloc</code>, etc.  There is also <code>proc_macro</code>, <code>test</code>, and
other runtime libraries.</p>
<p>This code is fairly similar to most other Rust crates except that it must be
built in a special way because it can use unstable features.</p>
<h2 id="other"><a class="header" href="#other">Other</a></h2>
<p>There are a lot of other things in the <code>rust-lang/rust</code> repo that are related
to building a full Rust distribution. Most of the time you don't need to worry
about them.</p>
<p>These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/ci"><code>src/ci</code></a>: The CI configuration. This actually quite extensive because we

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(compilers)"><em>Bootstrapping</em></a> is the process of using a compiler to compile itself.
More accurately, it means using an older compiler to compile a newer version
of the same compiler.</p>
<p>This raises a chicken-and-egg paradox: where did the first compiler come from?
It must have been written in a different language. In Rust's case it was
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/ef75860a0a72f79f97216f8aaa5b388d98da6480/src/boot">written in OCaml</a>. However it was abandoned long ago and the
only way to build a modern version of rustc is a slightly less modern
version.</p>
<p>This is exactly how <code>x.py</code> works: it downloads the current beta release of
rustc, then uses it to compile the new compiler.</p>
<h2 id="stages-of-bootstrapping"><a class="header" href="#stages-of-bootstrapping">Stages of bootstrapping</a></h2>
<p>Compiling <code>rustc</code> is done in stages. Here's a diagram, adapted from Joshua Nelson's
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUIjG-y4zaA">talk on bootstrapping</a> at RustConf 2022, with detailed explanations below.</p>

<h3 id="stage-0"><a class="header" href="#stage-0">Stage 0</a></h3>
<p>The stage0 compiler is usually the current <em>beta</em> <code>rustc</code> compiler
and its associated dynamic libraries,
which <code>x.py</code> will download for you.
(You can also configure <code>x.py</code> to use something else.)</p>
<p>The stage0 compiler is then used only to compile <code>src/bootstrap</code>, <code>std</code>, and <code>rustc</code>.
When compiling <code>rustc</code>, the stage0 compiler uses the freshly compiled <code>std</code>.
There are two concepts at play here:
a compiler (with its set of dependencies)
and its 'target' or 'object' libraries (<code>std</code> and <code>rustc</code>).
Both are staged, but in a staggered manner.</p>
<h3 id="stage-1"><a class="header" href="#stage-1">Stage 1</a></h3>
<p>The rustc source code is then compiled with the stage0 compiler to produce the stage1 compiler.</p>
<h3 id="stage-2"><a class="header" href="#stage-2">Stage 2</a></h3>
<p>We then rebuild our stage1 compiler with itself to produce the stage2 compiler.</p>
<p>In theory, the stage1 compiler is functionally identical to the stage2 compiler,
but in practice there are subtle differences.
In particular, the stage1 compiler itself was built by stage0
and hence not by the source in your working directory.
This means that the ABI generated by the stage0 compiler may not match the ABI that would have been
made by the stage1 compiler, which can cause problems for dynamic libraries, tests, and tools using
<code>rustc_private</code>.</p>
<p>Note that the <code>proc_macro</code> crate avoids this issue with a C FFI layer called <code>proc_macro::bridge</code>,
allowing it to be used with stage 1.</p>
<p>The <code>stage2</code> compiler is the one distributed with <code>rustup</code> and all other install methods.
However, it takes a very long time to build
because one must first build the new compiler with an older compiler
and then use that to build the new compiler with itself.
For development, you usually only want the <code>stage1</code> compiler,
which you can build with <code>./x.py build library</code>.
See <a href="building/./how-to-build-and-run.html#building-the-compiler">Building the Compiler</a>.</p>
<h3 id="stage-3"><a class="header" href="#stage-3">Stage 3</a></h3>
<p>Stage 3 is optional. To sanity check our new compiler, we
can build the libraries with the stage2 compiler. The result ought
to be identical to before, unless something has broken.</p>
<h3 id="building-the-stages"><a class="header" href="#building-the-stages">Building the stages</a></h3>
<p><code>x.py</code> tries to be helpful and pick the stage you most likely meant for each subcommand.
These defaults are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>check</code>: <code>--stage 0</code></li>
<li><code>doc</code>: <code>--stage 0</code></li>
<li><code>build</code>: <code>--stage 1</code></li>
<li><code>test</code>: <code>--stage 1</code></li>
<li><code>dist</code>: <code>--stage 2</code></li>
<li><code>install</code>: <code>--stage 2</code></li>
<li><code>bench</code>: <code>--stage 2</code></li>
</ul>
<p>You can always override the stage by passing <code>--stage N</code> explicitly.</p>

<h2 id="complications-of-bootstrapping"><a class="header" href="#complications-of-bootstrapping">Complications of bootstrapping</a></h2>
<p>Since the build system uses the current beta compiler to build the stage-1
bootstrapping compiler, the compiler source code can't use some features
until they reach beta (because otherwise the beta compiler doesn't support
them). On the other hand, for <a href="building/../appendix/glossary.html#intrinsic">compiler intrinsics</a> and internal
features, the features <em>have</em> to be used. Additionally, the compiler makes
heavy use of nightly features (<code>#![feature(...)]</code>). How can we resolve this
problem?</p>
<p>There are two methods used:</p>
<ol>
<li>The build system sets <code>--cfg bootstrap</code> when building with <code>stage0</code>, so we
can use <code>cfg(not(bootstrap))</code> to only use features when built with <code>stage1</code>.
This is useful for e.g. features that were just stabilized, which require
<code>#![feature(...)]</code> when built with <code>stage0</code>, but not for <code>stage1</code>.</li>
<li>The build system sets <code>RUSTC_BOOTSTRAP=1</code>. This special variable means to
<em>break the stability guarantees</em> of rust: Allow using <code>#![feature(...)]</code> with
a compiler that's not nightly. This should never be used except when
bootstrapping the compiler.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="contributing-to-bootstrap"><a class="header" href="#contributing-to-bootstrap">Contributing to bootstrap</a></h2>
<p>When you use the bootstrap system, you'll call it through <code>x.py</code>.
However, most of the code lives in <code>src/bootstrap</code>.
<code>bootstrap</code> has a difficult problem: it is written in Rust, but yet it is run
before the Rust compiler is built! To work around this, there are two
components of bootstrap: the main one written in rust, and <code>bootstrap.py</code>.
<code>bootstrap.py</code> is what gets run by <code>x.py</code>. It takes care of downloading the
<code>stage0</code> compiler, which will then build the bootstrap binary written in
Rust.</p>
<p>Because there are two separate codebases behind <code>x.py</code>, they need to
be kept in sync. In particular, both <code>bootstrap.py</code> and the bootstrap binary
parse <code>config.toml</code> and read the same command line arguments. <code>bootstrap.py</code>
keeps these in sync by setting various environment variables, and the
programs sometimes have to add arguments that are explicitly ignored, to be
read by the other.</p>

<h3 id="overview-1"><a class="header" href="#overview-1">Overview</a></h3>
<p>This is a detailed look into the separate bootstrap stages.</p>
<p>The convention <code>x.py</code> uses is that:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <code>--stage N</code> flag means to run the stage N compiler (<code>stageN/rustc</code>).</li>
<li>A &quot;stage N artifact&quot; is a build artifact that is <em>produced</em> by the stage N compiler.</li>
<li>The stage N+1 compiler is assembled from stage N <em>artifacts</em>. This
process is called <em>uplifting</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="build-artifacts"><a class="header" href="#build-artifacts">Build artifacts</a></h4>
<p>Anything you can build with <code>x.py</code> is a <em>build artifact</em>.
Build artifacts include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>binaries, like <code>stage0-rustc/rustc-main</code></li>
<li>shared objects, like <code>stage0-sysroot/rustlib/libstd-6fae108520cf72fe.so</code></li>
<li><a href="building/../serialization.html">rlib</a> files, like <code>stage0-sysroot/rustlib/libstd-6fae108520cf72fe.rlib</code></li>
<li>HTML files generated by rustdoc, like <code>doc/std</code></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="examples"><a class="header" href="#examples">Examples</a></h4>
<ul>
<li><code>./x.py build --stage 0</code> means to build with the beta <code>rustc</code>.</li>
<li><code>./x.py doc --stage 0</code> means to document using the beta <code>rustdoc</code>.</li>
<li><code>./x.py test --stage 0 library/std</code> means to run tests on the standard library
without building <code>rustc</code> from source ('build with stage 0, then test the
artifacts'). If you're working on the standard library, this is normally the
test command you want.</li>
<li><code>./x.py test tests/ui</code> means to build the stage 1 compiler and run
<code>compiletest</code> on it. If you're working on the compiler, this is normally the
test command you want.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="examples-of-what-not-to-do"><a class="header" href="#examples-of-what-not-to-do">Examples of what <em>not</em> to do</a></h4>
<ul>
<li><code>./x.py test --stage 0 tests/ui</code> is not useful: it runs tests on the
<em>beta</em> compiler and doesn't build <code>rustc</code> from source. Use <code>test tests/ui</code>
instead, which builds stage 1 from source.</li>
<li><code>./x.py test --stage 0 compiler/rustc</code> builds the compiler but runs no tests:
it's running <code>cargo test -p rustc</code>, but cargo doesn't understand Rust's
tests. You shouldn't need to use this, use <code>test</code> instead (without arguments).</li>
<li><code>./x.py build --stage 0 compiler/rustc</code> builds the compiler, but does not build
libstd or even libcore. Most of the time, you'll want <code>./x.py build library</code> instead, which allows compiling programs without needing to define
lang items.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="building-vs-running"><a class="header" href="#building-vs-running">Building vs. running</a></h3>
<p>Note that <code>build --stage N compiler/rustc</code> <strong>does not</strong> build the stage N compiler:
instead it builds the stage N+1 compiler <em>using</em> the stage N compiler.</p>
<p>In short, <em>stage 0 uses the stage0 compiler to create stage0 artifacts which
will later be uplifted to be the stage1 compiler</em>.</p>
<p>In each stage, two major steps are performed:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>std</code> is compiled by the stage N compiler.</li>
<li>That <code>std</code> is linked to programs built by the stage N compiler,
including the stage N artifacts (stage N+1 compiler).</li>
</ol>
<p>This is somewhat intuitive if one thinks of the stage N artifacts as &quot;just&quot;
another program we are building with the stage N compiler:
<code>build --stage N compiler/rustc</code> is linking the stage N artifacts to the <code>std</code>
built by the stage N compiler.</p>
<h3 id="stages-and-std"><a class="header" href="#stages-and-std">Stages and <code>std</code></a></h3>
<p>Note that there are two <code>std</code> libraries in play here:</p>
<ol>
<li>The library <em>linked</em> to <code>stageN/rustc</code>, which was built by stage N-1 (stage N-1 <code>std</code>)</li>
<li>The library <em>used to compile programs</em> with <code>stageN/rustc</code>, which was
built by stage N (stage N <code>std</code>).</li>
</ol>
<p>Stage N <code>std</code> is pretty much necessary for any useful work with the stage N compiler.
Without it, you can only compile programs with <code>#![no_core]</code> -- not terribly useful!</p>
<p>The reason these need to be different is because they aren't necessarily ABI-compatible:
there could be new layout optimizations, changes to MIR, or other changes
to Rust metadata on nightly that aren't present in beta.</p>
<p>This is also where <code>--keep-stage 1 library/std</code> comes into play. Since most
changes to the compiler don't actually change the ABI, once you've produced a
<code>std</code> in stage 1, you can probably just reuse it with a different compiler.
If the ABI hasn't changed, you're good to go, no need to spend time
recompiling that <code>std</code>.
<code>--keep-stage</code> simply assumes the previous compile is fine and copies those
artifacts into the appropriate place, skipping the cargo invocation.</p>
<h3 id="cross-compiling-rustc"><a class="header" href="#cross-compiling-rustc">Cross-compiling rustc</a></h3>
<p><em>Cross-compiling</em> is the process of compiling code that will run on another architecture.
For instance, you might want to build an ARM version of rustc using an x86 machine.
Building stage2 <code>std</code> is different when you are cross-compiling.</p>
<p>This is because <code>x.py</code> uses a trick: if <code>HOST</code> and <code>TARGET</code> are the same,
it will reuse stage1 <code>std</code> for stage2! This is sound because stage1 <code>std</code>
was compiled with the stage1 compiler, i.e. a compiler using the source code
you currently have checked out. So it should be identical (and therefore ABI-compatible)
to the <code>std</code> that <code>stage2/rustc</code> would compile.</p>
<p>However, when cross-compiling, stage1 <code>std</code> will only run on the host.
So the stage2 compiler has to recompile <code>std</code> for the target.</p>
<p>(See in the table how stage2 only builds non-host <code>std</code> targets).</p>
<h3 id="why-does-only-libstd-use-cfgbootstrap"><a class="header" href="#why-does-only-libstd-use-cfgbootstrap">Why does only libstd use <code>cfg(bootstrap)</code>?</a></h3>
<p>The <code>rustc</code> generated by the stage0 compiler is linked to the freshly-built
<code>std</code>, which means that for the most part only <code>std</code> needs to be cfg-gated,
so that <code>rustc</code> can use features added to std immediately after their addition,
without need for them to get into the downloaded beta.</p>
<p>Note this is different from any other Rust program: stage1 <code>rustc</code>
is built by the <em>beta</em> compiler, but using the <em>master</em> version of libstd!</p>
<p>The only time <code>rustc</code> uses <code>cfg(bootstrap)</code> is when it adds internal lints
that use diagnostic items. This happens very rarely.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-a-sysroot"><a class="header" href="#what-is-a-sysroot">What is a 'sysroot'?</a></h3>
<p>When you build a project with cargo, the build artifacts for dependencies
are normally stored in <code>target/debug/deps</code>. This only contains dependencies cargo
knows about; in particular, it doesn't have the standard library. Where do
<code>std</code> or <code>proc_macro</code> come from? It comes from the <strong>sysroot</strong>, the root
of a number of directories where the compiler loads build artifacts at runtime.
The sysroot doesn't just store the standard library, though - it includes
anything that needs to be loaded at runtime. That includes (but is not limited
to):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>libstd</code>/<code>libtest</code>/<code>libproc_macro</code></li>
<li>The compiler crates themselves, when using <code>rustc_private</code>. In-tree these
are always present; out of tree, you need to install <code>rustc-dev</code> with rustup.</li>
<li><code>libLLVM.so</code>, the shared object file for the LLVM project. In-tree this is
either built from source or downloaded from CI; out-of-tree, you need to
install <code>llvm-tools-preview</code> with rustup.</li>
</ul>
<p>All the artifacts listed so far are <em>compiler</em> runtime dependencies. You can
see them with <code>rustc --print sysroot</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ ls $(rustc --print sysroot)/lib
libchalk_derive-0685d79833dc9b2b.so  libstd-25c6acf8063a3802.so
libLLVM-11-rust-1.50.0-nightly.so    libtest-57470d2aa8f7aa83.so

librustc_macros-5f0ec4a119c6ac86.so  rustlib
</code></pre>
<p>There are also runtime dependencies for the standard library! These are in
<code>lib/rustlib</code>, not <code>lib/</code> directly.</p>
<pre><code>$ ls $(rustc --print sysroot)/lib/rustlib/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/lib | head -n 5
libaddr2line-6c8e02b8fedc1e5f.rlib

libcompiler_builtins-ef2408da76957905.rlib
</code></pre>
<p><code>rustlib</code> includes libraries like <code>hashbrown</code> and <code>cfg_if</code>, which are not part
of the public API of the standard library, but are used to implement it.
<code>rustlib</code> is part of the search path for linkers, but <code>lib</code> will never be part
of the search path.</p>
<h4 id="-z-force-unstable-if-unmarked"><a class="header" href="#-z-force-unstable-if-unmarked">-Z force-unstable-if-unmarked</a></h4>
<p>Since <code>rustlib</code> is part of the search path, it means we have to be careful
about which crates are included in it. In particular, all crates except for
the standard library are built with the flag <code>-Z force-unstable-if-unmarked</code>,
which means that you have to use <code>#![feature(rustc_private)]</code> in order to
load it (as opposed to the standard library, which is always available).</p>
<p>The <code>-Z force-unstable-if-unmarked</code> flag has a variety of purposes to help
enforce that the correct crates are marked as unstable. It was introduced
primarily to allow rustc and the standard library to link to arbitrary crates
on crates.io which do not themselves use <code>staged_api</code>. <code>rustc</code> also relies on
this flag to mark all of its crates as unstable with the <code>rustc_private</code>
feature so that each crate does not need to be carefully marked with
<code>unstable</code>.</p>
<p>This flag is automatically applied to all of <code>rustc</code> and the standard library
by the bootstrap scripts. This is needed because the compiler and all of its
dependencies are shipped in the sysroot to all users.</p>
<p>This flag has the following effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Marks the crate as &quot;unstable&quot; with the <code>rustc_private</code> feature if it is not
itself marked as stable or unstable.</li>
<li>Allows these crates to access other forced-unstable crates without any need
for attributes. Normally a crate would need a <code>#![feature(rustc_private)]</code>
attribute to use other unstable crates. However, that would make it
impossible for a crate from crates.io to access its own dependencies since
that crate won't have a <code>feature(rustc_private)</code> attribute, but <em>everything</em>
is compiled with <code>-Z force-unstable-if-unmarked</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Code which does not use <code>-Z force-unstable-if-unmarked</code> should include the
<code>#![feature(rustc_private)]</code> crate attribute to access these force-unstable
crates. This is needed for things that link <code>rustc</code>, such as <code>miri</code> or
<code>clippy</code>.</p>

<h2 id="passing-flags-to-commands-invoked-by-bootstrap"><a class="header" href="#passing-flags-to-commands-invoked-by-bootstrap">Passing flags to commands invoked by <code>bootstrap</code></a></h2>
<p><code>x.py</code> allows you to pass stage-specific flags to <code>rustc</code> and <code>cargo</code> when bootstrapping.
The <code>RUSTFLAGS_BOOTSTRAP</code> environment variable is passed as <code>RUSTFLAGS</code> to the bootstrap stage
(stage0), and <code>RUSTFLAGS_NOT_BOOTSTRAP</code> is passed when building artifacts for later stages.
<code>RUSTFLAGS</code> will work, but also affects the build of <code>bootstrap</code> itself, so it will be rare to want
to use it.
Finally, <code>MAGIC_EXTRA_RUSTFLAGS</code> bypasses the <code>cargo</code> cache to pass flags to rustc without
recompiling all dependencies.</p>
<p><code>RUSTDOCFLAGS</code>, <code>RUSTDOCFLAGS_BOOTSTRAP</code>, and <code>RUSTDOCFLAGS_NOT_BOOTSTRAP</code> are anologous to
<code>RUSTFLAGS</code>, but for rustdoc.</p>
<p><code>CARGOFLAGS</code> will pass arguments to cargo itself (e.g. <code>--timings</code>). <code>CARGOFLAGS_BOOTSTRAP</code> and
<code>CARGOFLAGS_NOT_BOOTSTRAP</code> work analogously to <code>RUSTFLAGS_BOOTSTRAP</code>.</p>
<p><code>--test-args</code> will pass arguments through to the test runner. For <code>tests/ui</code>, this is
compiletest; for unit tests and doctests this is the <code>libtest</code> runner. Most test runner accept
<code>--help</code>, which you can use to find out the options accepted by the runner.</p>
<h2 id="environment-variables"><a class="header" href="#environment-variables">Environment Variables</a></h2>
<p>During bootstrapping, there are a bunch of compiler-internal environment
variables that are used. If you are trying to run an intermediate version of
<code>rustc</code>, sometimes you may need to set some of these environment variables
manually. Otherwise, you get an error like the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">thread 'main' panicked at 'RUSTC_STAGE was not set: NotPresent', library/core/src/result.rs:1165:5
</code></pre>
<p>If <code>./stageN/bin/rustc</code> gives an error about environment variables, that
usually means something is quite wrong -- or you're trying to compile e.g.
<code>rustc</code> or <code>std</code> or something that depends on environment variables. In
the unlikely case that you actually need to invoke rustc in such a situation,
you can tell the bootstrap shim to print all env variables by adding <code>-vvv</code> to your <code>x.py</code> command.</p>

<p>As described in <a href="./compiler-src.html">the high-level overview of the compiler</a>, the Rust compiler
is still (as of <!-- date-check --> July 2021) transitioning from a
traditional &quot;pass-based&quot; setup to a &quot;demand-driven&quot; system. The compiler query
system is the key to rustc's demand-driven organization.
The idea is pretty simple. Instead of entirely independent passes
(parsing, type-checking, etc.), a set of function-like <em>queries</em>
compute information about the input source. For example,
there is a query called <code>type_of</code> that, given the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_span/def_id/struct.DefId.html"><code>DefId</code></a> of
some item, will compute the type of that item and return it to you.</p>
<p>Query execution is <em>memoized</em>. The first time you invoke a
query, it will go do the computation, but the next time, the result is
returned from a hashtable. Moreover, query execution fits nicely into
<em>incremental computation</em>; the idea is roughly that, when you invoke a
query, the result <em>may</em> be returned to you by loading stored data
from disk.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#incr-comp-detail">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Eventually, we want the entire compiler
control-flow to be query driven. There will effectively be one
top-level query (<code>compile</code>) that will run compilation on a crate; this
will in turn demand information about that crate, starting from the
<em>end</em>.  For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>compile</code> query might demand to get a list of codegen-units
(i.e. modules that need to be compiled by LLVM).</li>
<li>But computing the list of codegen-units would invoke some subquery
that returns the list of all modules defined in the Rust source.</li>
<li>That query in turn would invoke something asking for the HIR.</li>
<li>This keeps going further and further back until we wind up doing the
actual parsing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although this vision is not fully realized, large sections of the
compiler (for example, generating <a href="./mir/index.html">MIR</a>) currently work exactly like this.</p>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="incr-comp-detail"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>The <a href="queries/incremental-compilation-in-detail.html">&quot;Incremental Compilation in Detail</a> chapter gives a more
in-depth description of what queries are and how they work.
If you intend to write a query of your own, this is a good read.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="invoking-queries"><a class="header" href="#invoking-queries">Invoking queries</a></h2>
<p>Invoking a query is simple. The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/struct.TyCtxt.html"><code>TyCtxt</code></a> (&quot;type context&quot;) struct offers a method
for each defined query. For example, to invoke the <code>type_of</code>
query, you would just do this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let ty = tcx.type_of(some_def_id);
</code></pre>
<h2 id="how-the-compiler-executes-a-query"><a class="header" href="#how-the-compiler-executes-a-query">How the compiler executes a query</a></h2>
<p>So you may be wondering what happens when you invoke a query
method. The answer is that, for each query, the compiler maintains a
cache – if your query has already been executed, then, the answer is
simple: we clone the return value out of the cache and return it
(therefore, you should try to ensure that the return types of queries
are cheaply cloneable; insert an <code>Rc</code> if necessary).</p>
<h3 id="providers"><a class="header" href="#providers">Providers</a></h3>
<p>If, however, the query is <em>not</em> in the cache, then the compiler will
try to find a suitable <strong>provider</strong>. A provider is a function that has
been defined and linked into the compiler somewhere that contains the
code to compute the result of the query.</p>
<p><strong>Providers are defined per-crate.</strong> The compiler maintains,
internally, a table of providers for every crate, at least
conceptually. Right now, there are really two sets: the providers for
queries about the <strong>local crate</strong> (that is, the one being compiled)
and providers for queries about <strong>external crates</strong> (that is,
dependencies of the local crate). Note that what determines the crate
that a query is targeting is not the <em>kind</em> of query, but the <em>key</em>.
For example, when you invoke <code>tcx.type_of(def_id)</code>, that could be a
local query or an external query, depending on what crate the <code>def_id</code>
is referring to (see the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/query/keys/trait.Key.html"><code>self::keys::Key</code></a> trait for more
information on how that works).</p>
<p>Providers always have the same signature:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn provider&lt;'tcx&gt;(
    tcx: TyCtxt&lt;'tcx&gt;,
    key: QUERY_KEY,
) -&gt; QUERY_RESULT {
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>Providers take two arguments: the <code>tcx</code> and the query key.
They return the result of the query.</p>
<h3 id="how-providers-are-setup"><a class="header" href="#how-providers-are-setup">How providers are setup</a></h3>
<p>When the tcx is created, it is given the providers by its creator using
the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/query/struct.Providers.html"><code>Providers</code></a> struct. This struct is generated by
the macros here, but it is basically a big list of function pointers:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">struct Providers {
    type_of: for&lt;'tcx&gt; fn(TyCtxt&lt;'tcx&gt;, DefId) -&gt; Ty&lt;'tcx&gt;,
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>At present, we have one copy of the struct for local crates, and one
for external crates, though the plan is that we may eventually have
one per crate.</p>
<p>These <code>Providers</code> structs are ultimately created and populated by
<code>rustc_driver</code>, but it does this by distributing the work
throughout the other <code>rustc_*</code> crates. This is done by invoking
various <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/hir/fn.provide.html"><code>provide</code></a> functions. These functions tend to look
something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub fn provide(providers: &amp;mut Providers) {
    *providers = Providers {
        type_of,
        ..*providers
    };
}
</code></pre>
<p>That is, they take an <code>&amp;mut Providers</code> and mutate it in place. Usually
we use the formulation above just because it looks nice, but you could
as well do <code>providers.type_of = type_of</code>, which would be equivalent.
(Here, <code>type_of</code> would be a top-level function, defined as we saw
before.) So, if we want to add a provider for some other query,
let's call it <code>fubar</code>, into the crate above, we might modify the <code>provide()</code>
function like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub fn provide(providers: &amp;mut Providers) {
    *providers = Providers {
        type_of,
        fubar,
        ..*providers
    };
}

fn fubar&lt;'tcx&gt;(tcx: TyCtxt&lt;'tcx&gt;, key: DefId) -&gt; Fubar&lt;'tcx&gt; { ... }
</code></pre>
<p>N.B. Most of the <code>rustc_*</code> crates only provide <strong>local
providers</strong>. Almost all <strong>extern providers</strong> wind up going through the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_metadata/index.html"><code>rustc_metadata</code> crate</a>, which loads the information
from the crate metadata. But in some cases there are crates that
provide queries for <em>both</em> local and external crates, in which case
they define both a <code>provide</code> and a <code>provide_extern</code> function, through
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_codegen_ssa/back/symbol_export/fn.wasm_import_module_map.html"><code>wasm_import_module_map</code></a>, that <code>rustc_driver</code> can invoke.</p>
<h2 id="adding-a-new-query"><a class="header" href="#adding-a-new-query">Adding a new query</a></h2>
<p>How do you add a new query?
Defining a query takes place in two steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Declare the query name, its arguments and description.</li>
<li>Supply query providers where needed.</li>
</ol>
<p>To declare the query name and arguments, you simply add an entry to
the big macro invocation in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/query/index.html"><code>compiler/rustc_middle/src/query/mod.rs</code></a>.
Then you need to add a documentation comment to it with some <em>internal</em> description.
Then, provide the <code>desc</code> attribute which contains a <em>user-facing</em> description of the query.
The <code>desc</code> attribute is shown to the user in query cycles.</p>
<p>This looks something like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">rustc_queries! {
    /// Records the type of every item.
    query type_of(key: DefId) -&gt; Ty&lt;'tcx&gt; {
        cache_on_disk_if { key.is_local() }
        desc { |tcx| &quot;computing the type of `{}`&quot;, tcx.def_path_str(key) }
    }
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>A query definition has the following form:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">query type_of(key: DefId) -&gt; Ty&lt;'tcx&gt; { ... }
^^^^^ ^^^^^^^      ^^^^^     ^^^^^^^^   ^^^
|     |            |         |          |
|     |            |         |          query modifiers
|     |            |         result type
|     |            query key type
|     name of query
query keyword
</code></pre>
<p>Let's go over these elements one by one:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Query keyword:</strong> indicates a start of a query definition.</li>
<li><strong>Name of query:</strong> the name of the query method
(<code>tcx.type_of(..)</code>). Also used as the name of a struct
(<code>ty::queries::type_of</code>) that will be generated to represent
this query.</li>
<li><strong>Query key type:</strong> the type of the argument to this query.
This type must implement the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/query/keys/trait.Key.html"><code>ty::query::keys::Key</code></a> trait, which
defines (for example) how to map it to a crate, and so forth.</li>
<li><strong>Result type of query:</strong> the type produced by this query. This type
should (a) not use <code>RefCell</code> or other interior mutability and (b) be
cheaply cloneable. Interning or using <code>Rc</code> or <code>Arc</code> is recommended for
non-trivial data types.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#steal">2</a></sup></li>
<li><strong>Query modifiers:</strong> various flags and options that customize how the
query is processed (mostly with respect to <a href="queries/incremental-compilation-in-detail.html#query-modifiers">incremental compilation</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p>So, to add a query:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add an entry to <code>rustc_queries!</code> using the format above.</li>
<li>Link the provider by modifying the appropriate <code>provide</code> method;
or add a new one if needed and ensure that <code>rustc_driver</code> is invoking it.</li>
</ul>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="steal"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">2</sup>
<p>The one exception to those rules is the <code>ty::steal::Steal</code> type,
which is used to cheaply modify MIR in place. See the definition
of <code>Steal</code> for more details. New uses of <code>Steal</code> should <strong>not</strong> be
added without alerting <code>@rust-lang/compiler</code>.</p>

<p>This chapter provides a deeper dive into the abstract model queries are built on.
It does not go into implementation details but tries to explain
the underlying logic. The examples here, therefore, have been stripped down and
simplified and don't directly reflect the compilers internal APIs.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-query"><a class="header" href="#what-is-a-query">What is a query?</a></h2>
<p>Abstractly we view the compiler's knowledge about a given crate as a &quot;database&quot;
and queries are the way of asking the compiler questions about it, i.e.
we &quot;query&quot; the compiler's &quot;database&quot; for facts.</p>
<p>However, there's something special to this compiler database: It starts out empty
and is filled on-demand when queries are executed. Consequently, a query must
know how to compute its result if the database does not contain it yet. For
doing so, it can access other queries and certain input values that the database
is pre-filled with on creation.</p>
<p>A query thus consists of the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li>A name that identifies the query</li>
<li>A &quot;key&quot; that specifies what we want to look up</li>
<li>A result type that specifies what kind of result it yields</li>
<li>A &quot;provider&quot; which is a function that specifies how the result is to be
computed if it isn't already present in the database.</li>
</ul>
<p>As an example, the name of the <code>type_of</code> query is <code>type_of</code>, its query key is a
<code>DefId</code> identifying the item we want to know the type of, the result type is
<code>Ty&lt;'tcx&gt;</code>, and the provider is a function that, given the query key and access
to the rest of the database, can compute the type of the item identified by the
key.</p>
<p>So in some sense a query is just a function that maps the query key to the
corresponding result. However, we have to apply some restrictions in order for
this to be sound:</p>
<ul>
<li>The key and result must be immutable values.</li>
<li>The provider function must be a pure function in the sense that for the same
key it must always yield the same result.</li>
<li>The only parameters a provider function takes are the key and a reference to
the &quot;query context&quot; (which provides access to the rest of the &quot;database&quot;).</li>
</ul>
<p>The database is built up lazily by invoking queries. The query providers will
invoke other queries, for which the result is either already cached or computed
by calling another query provider. These query provider invocations
conceptually form a directed acyclic graph (DAG) at the leaves of which are
input values that are already known when the query context is created.</p>
<h2 id="cachingmemoization"><a class="header" href="#cachingmemoization">Caching/Memoization</a></h2>
<p>Results of query invocations are &quot;memoized&quot; which means that the query context
will cache the result in an internal table and, when the query is invoked with
the same query key again, will return the result from the cache instead of
running the provider again.</p>
<p>This caching is crucial for making the query engine efficient. Without
memoization the system would still be sound (that is, it would yield the same
results) but the same computations would be done over and over again.</p>
<p>Memoization is one of the main reasons why query providers have to be pure
functions. If calling a provider function could yield different results for
each invocation (because it accesses some global mutable state) then we could
not memoize the result.</p>
<h2 id="input-data"><a class="header" href="#input-data">Input data</a></h2>
<p>When the query context is created, it is still empty: No queries have been
executed, no results are cached. But the context already provides access to
&quot;input&quot; data, i.e. pieces of immutable data that were computed before the
context was created and that queries can access to do their computations.</p>
<p>As of <!-- date-check --> January 2021, this input data consists mainly of
the HIR map, upstream crate metadata, and the command-line options the compiler
was invoked with; but in the future inputs will just consist of command-line
options and a list of source files -- the HIR map will itself be provided by a
query which processes these source files.</p>
<p>Without inputs, queries would live in a void without anything to compute their
result from (remember, query providers only have access to other queries and
the context but not any other outside state or information).</p>
<p>For a query provider, input data and results of other queries look exactly the
same: It just tells the context &quot;give me the value of X&quot;. Because input data
is immutable, the provider can rely on it being the same across
different query invocations, just as is the case for query results.</p>
<h2 id="an-example-execution-trace-of-some-queries"><a class="header" href="#an-example-execution-trace-of-some-queries">An example execution trace of some queries</a></h2>
<p>How does this DAG of query invocations come into existence? At some point
the compiler driver will create the, as yet empty, query context. It will then,
from outside of the query system, invoke the queries it needs to perform its
task. This looks something like the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn compile_crate() {
    let cli_options = ...;
    let hir_map = ...;

    // Create the query context `tcx`
    let tcx = TyCtxt::new(cli_options, hir_map);

    // Do type checking by invoking the type check query
    tcx.type_check_crate();
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>type_check_crate</code> query provider would look something like the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn type_check_crate_provider(tcx, _key: ()) {
    let list_of_hir_items = tcx.hir_map.list_of_items();

    for item_def_id in list_of_hir_items {
        tcx.type_check_item(item_def_id);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>We see that the <code>type_check_crate</code> query accesses input data
(<code>tcx.hir_map.list_of_items()</code>) and invokes other queries
(<code>type_check_item</code>). The <code>type_check_item</code>
invocations will themselves access input data and/or invoke other queries,
so that in the end the DAG of query invocations will be built up backwards
from the node that was initially executed:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ignore">         (2)                                                 (1)
  list_of_all_hir_items &lt;----------------------------- type_check_crate()
                                                               |
    (5)             (4)                  (3)                   |
  Hir(foo) &lt;--- type_of(foo) &lt;--- type_check_item(foo) &lt;-------+
                                      |                        |
                    +-----------------+                        |
                    |                                          |
    (7)             v  (6)                  (8)                |
  Hir(bar) &lt;--- type_of(bar) &lt;--- type_check_item(bar) &lt;-------+

// (x) denotes invocation order
</code></pre>
<p>We also see that often a query result can be read from the cache:
<code>type_of(bar)</code> was computed for <code>type_check_item(foo)</code> so when
<code>type_check_item(bar)</code> needs it, it is already in the cache.</p>
<p>Query results stay cached in the query context as long as the context lives.
So if the compiler driver invoked another query later on, the above graph
would still exist and already executed queries would not have to be re-done.</p>
<h2 id="cycles"><a class="header" href="#cycles">Cycles</a></h2>
<p>Earlier we stated that query invocations form a DAG. However, it would be easy
to form a cyclic graph by, for example, having a query provider like the
following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn cyclic_query_provider(tcx, key) -&gt; u32 {
  // Invoke the same query with the same key again
  tcx.cyclic_query(key)
}
</code></pre>
<p>Since query providers are regular functions, this would behave much as expected:
Evaluation would get stuck in an infinite recursion. A query like this would not
be very useful either. However, sometimes certain kinds of invalid user input
can result in queries being called in a cyclic way. The query engine includes
a check for cyclic invocations and, because cycles are an irrecoverable error,
will abort execution with a &quot;cycle error&quot; messages that tries to be human
readable.</p>
<p>At some point the compiler had a notion of &quot;cycle recovery&quot;, that is, one could
&quot;try&quot; to execute a query and if it ended up causing a cycle, proceed in some
other fashion. However, this was later removed because it is not entirely
clear what the theoretical consequences of this are, especially regarding
incremental compilation.</p>
<h2 id="steal-queries"><a class="header" href="#steal-queries">&quot;Steal&quot; Queries</a></h2>
<p>Some queries have their result wrapped in a <code>Steal&lt;T&gt;</code> struct. These queries
behave exactly the same as regular with one exception: Their result is expected
to be &quot;stolen&quot; out of the cache at some point, meaning some other part of the
program is taking ownership of it and the result cannot be accessed anymore.</p>
<p>This stealing mechanism exists purely as a performance optimization because some
result values are too costly to clone (e.g. the MIR of a function). It seems
like result stealing would violate the condition that query results must be
immutable (after all we are moving the result value out of the cache) but it is
OK as long as the mutation is not observable. This is achieved by two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Before a result is stolen, we make sure to eagerly run all queries that
might ever need to read that result. This has to be done manually by calling
those queries.</li>
<li>Whenever a query tries to access a stolen result, we make an ICE
(Internal Compiler Error) so that such a condition cannot go unnoticed.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is not an ideal setup because of the manual intervention needed, so it
should be used sparingly and only when it is well known which queries might
access a given result. In practice, however, stealing has not turned out to be
much of a maintenance burden.</p>
<p>To summarize: &quot;Steal queries&quot; break some of the rules in a controlled way.
There are checks in place that make sure that nothing can go silently wrong.</p>

<p>The incremental compilation scheme is, in essence, a surprisingly
simple extension to the overall query system. We'll start by describing
a slightly simplified variant of the real thing – the &quot;basic algorithm&quot; –
and then describe some possible improvements.</p>
<h2 id="the-basic-algorithm"><a class="header" href="#the-basic-algorithm">The basic algorithm</a></h2>
<p>The basic algorithm is
called the <strong>red-green</strong> algorithm<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#salsa">1</a></sup>. The high-level idea is
that, after each run of the compiler, we will save the results of all
the queries that we do, as well as the <strong>query DAG</strong>. The
<strong>query DAG</strong> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">DAG</a> that indexes which queries executed which
other queries. So, for example, there would be an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_graph_theory_terms#edge">edge</a> from a query Q1
to another query Q2 if computing Q1 required computing Q2 (note that
because queries cannot depend on themselves, this results in a DAG and
not a general graph).</p>
<p>On the next run of the compiler, then, we can sometimes reuse these
query results to avoid re-executing a query. We do this by assigning
every query a <strong>color</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a query is colored <strong>red</strong>, that means that its result during
this compilation has <strong>changed</strong> from the previous compilation.</li>
<li>If a query is colored <strong>green</strong>, that means that its result is
the <strong>same</strong> as the previous compilation.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two key insights here:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, if all the inputs to query Q are colored green, then the
query Q <strong>must</strong> result in the same value as last time and hence
need not be re-executed (or else the compiler is not deterministic).</li>
<li>Second, even if some inputs to a query changes, it may be that it
<strong>still</strong> produces the same result as the previous compilation. In
particular, the query may only use part of its input.
<ul>
<li>Therefore, after executing a query, we always check whether it
produced the same result as the previous time. <strong>If it did,</strong> we
can still mark the query as green, and hence avoid re-executing
dependent queries.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-try-mark-green-algorithm"><a class="header" href="#the-try-mark-green-algorithm">The try-mark-green algorithm</a></h3>
<p>At the core of incremental compilation is an algorithm called
&quot;try-mark-green&quot;. It has the job of determining the color of a given
query Q (which must not have yet been executed). In cases where Q has
red inputs, determining Q's color may involve re-executing Q so that
we can compare its output, but if all of Q's inputs are green, then we
can conclude that Q must be green without re-executing it or inspecting
its value at all. In the compiler, this allows us to avoid
deserializing the result from disk when we don't need it, and in fact
enables us to sometimes skip <em>serializing</em> the result as well
(see the refinements section below).</p>
<p>Try-mark-green works as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>First check if the query Q was executed during the previous compilation.
<ul>
<li>If not, we can just re-execute the query as normal, and assign it the
color of red.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If yes, then load the 'dependent queries' of Q.</li>
<li>If there is a saved result, then we load the <code>reads(Q)</code> vector from the
query DAG. The &quot;reads&quot; is the set of queries that Q executed during
its execution.
<ul>
<li>For each query R in <code>reads(Q)</code>, we recursively demand the color
of R using try-mark-green.
<ul>
<li>Note: it is important that we visit each node in <code>reads(Q)</code> in same order
as they occurred in the original compilation. See <a href="queries/incremental-compilation.html#dag">the section on the
query DAG below</a>.</li>
<li>If <strong>any</strong> of the nodes in <code>reads(Q)</code> wind up colored <strong>red</strong>, then Q is
dirty.
<ul>
<li>We re-execute Q and compare the hash of its result to the hash of the
result from the previous compilation.</li>
<li>If the hash has not changed, we can mark Q as <strong>green</strong> and return.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Otherwise, <strong>all</strong> of the nodes in <code>reads(Q)</code> must be <strong>green</strong>. In that
case, we can color Q as <strong>green</strong> and return.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a name="dag"></a></p>
<h3 id="the-query-dag"><a class="header" href="#the-query-dag">The query DAG</a></h3>
<p>The query DAG code is stored in
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/dep_graph/index.html"><code>compiler/rustc_middle/src/dep_graph</code></a>. Construction of the DAG is done
by instrumenting the query execution.</p>
<p>One key point is that the query DAG also tracks ordering; that is, for
each query Q, we not only track the queries that Q reads, we track the
<strong>order</strong> in which they were read.  This allows try-mark-green to walk
those queries back in the same order. This is important because once a
subquery comes back as red, we can no longer be sure that Q will continue
along the same path as before. That is, imagine a query like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn main_query(tcx) {
    if tcx.subquery1() {
        tcx.subquery2()
    } else {
        tcx.subquery3()
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now imagine that in the first compilation, <code>main_query</code> starts by
executing <code>subquery1</code>, and this returns true. In that case, the next
query <code>main_query</code> executes will be <code>subquery2</code>, and <code>subquery3</code> will
not be executed at all.</p>
<p>But now imagine that in the <strong>next</strong> compilation, the input has
changed such that <code>subquery1</code> returns <strong>false</strong>. In this case, <code>subquery2</code>
would never execute. If try-mark-green were to visit <code>reads(main_query)</code> out
of order, however, it might visit <code>subquery2</code> before <code>subquery1</code>, and hence
execute it.
This can lead to ICEs and other problems in the compiler.</p>
<h2 id="improvements-to-the-basic-algorithm"><a class="header" href="#improvements-to-the-basic-algorithm">Improvements to the basic algorithm</a></h2>
<p>In the description of the basic algorithm, we said that at the end of
compilation we would save the results of all the queries that were
performed.  In practice, this can be quite wasteful – many of those
results are very cheap to recompute, and serializing and deserializing
them is not a particular win. In practice, what we would do is to save
<strong>the hashes</strong> of all the subqueries that we performed. Then, in select cases,
we <strong>also</strong> save the results.</p>
<p>This is why the incremental algorithm separates computing the
<strong>color</strong> of a node, which often does not require its value, from
computing the <strong>result</strong> of a node. Computing the result is done via a simple
algorithm like so:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check if a saved result for Q is available. If so, compute the color of Q.
If Q is green, deserialize and return the saved result.</li>
<li>Otherwise, execute Q.
<ul>
<li>We can then compare the hash of the result and color Q as green if
it did not change.</li>
</ul>

<p>The incremental compilation scheme is, in essence, a surprisingly
simple extension to the overall query system. It relies on the fact that:</p>
<ol>
<li>queries are pure functions -- given the same inputs, a query will always
yield the same result, and</li>
<li>the query model structures compilation in an acyclic graph that makes
dependencies between individual computations explicit.</li>
</ol>
<p>This chapter will explain how we can use these properties for making things
incremental and then goes on to discuss version implementation issues.</p>
<h2 id="a-basic-algorithm-for-incremental-query-evaluation"><a class="header" href="#a-basic-algorithm-for-incremental-query-evaluation">A Basic Algorithm For Incremental Query Evaluation</a></h2>
<p>As explained in the <a href="queries/./query-evaluation-model-in-detail.html">query evaluation model primer</a>, query
invocations form a directed-acyclic graph. Here's the example from the
previous chapter again:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ignore">  list_of_all_hir_items &lt;----------------------------- type_check_crate()
                                                               |
                                                               |
  Hir(foo) &lt;--- type_of(foo) &lt;--- type_check_item(foo) &lt;-------+
                                      |                        |
                    +-----------------+                        |

                    v                                          |
  Hir(bar) &lt;--- type_of(bar) &lt;--- type_check_item(bar) &lt;-------+
</code></pre>
<p>Since every access from one query to another has to go through the query
context, we can record these accesses and thus actually build this dependency
graph in memory. With dependency tracking enabled, when compilation is done,
we know which queries were invoked (the nodes of the graph) and for each
invocation, which other queries or input has gone into computing the query's
result (the edges of the graph).</p>
<p>Now suppose we change the source code of our program so that
HIR of <code>bar</code> looks different than before. Our goal is to only recompute
those queries that are actually affected by the change while re-using
the cached results of all the other queries. Given the dependency graph we can
do exactly that. For a given query invocation, the graph tells us exactly
what data has gone into computing its results, we just have to follow the
edges until we reach something that has changed. If we don't encounter
anything that has changed, we know that the query still would evaluate to
the same result we already have in our cache.</p>
<p>Taking the <code>type_of(foo)</code> invocation from above as an example, we can check
whether the cached result is still valid by following the edges to its
inputs. The only edge leads to <code>Hir(foo)</code>, an input that has not been affected
by the change. So we know that the cached result for <code>type_of(foo)</code> is still
valid.</p>
<p>The story is a bit different for <code>type_check_item(foo)</code>: We again walk the
edges and already know that <code>type_of(foo)</code> is fine. Then we get to
<code>type_of(bar)</code> which we have not checked yet, so we walk the edges of
<code>type_of(bar)</code> and encounter <code>Hir(bar)</code> which <em>has</em> changed. Consequently
the result of <code>type_of(bar)</code> might yield a different result than what we
have in the cache and, transitively, the result of <code>type_check_item(foo)</code>
might have changed too. We thus re-run <code>type_check_item(foo)</code>, which in
turn will re-run <code>type_of(bar)</code>, which will yield an up-to-date result
because it reads the up-to-date version of <code>Hir(bar)</code>. Also, we re-run
<code>type_check_item(bar)</code> because result of <code>type_of(bar)</code> might have changed.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem-with-the-basic-algorithm-false-positives"><a class="header" href="#the-problem-with-the-basic-algorithm-false-positives">The Problem With The Basic Algorithm: False Positives</a></h2>
<p>If you read the previous paragraph carefully you'll notice that it says that
<code>type_of(bar)</code> <em>might</em> have changed because one of its inputs has changed.
There's also the possibility that it might still yield exactly the same
result <em>even though</em> its input has changed. Consider an example with a
simple query that just computes the sign of an integer:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ignore">  IntValue(x) &lt;---- sign_of(x) &lt;--- some_other_query(x)
</code></pre>
<p>Let's say that <code>IntValue(x)</code> starts out as <code>1000</code> and then is set to <code>2000</code>.
Even though <code>IntValue(x)</code> is different in the two cases, <code>sign_of(x)</code> yields
the result <code>+</code> in both cases.</p>
<p>If we follow the basic algorithm, however, <code>some_other_query(x)</code> would have to
(unnecessarily) be re-evaluated because it transitively depends on a changed
input. Change detection yields a &quot;false positive&quot; in this case because it has
to conservatively assume that <code>some_other_query(x)</code> might be affected by that
changed input.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it turns out that the actual queries in the compiler are full
of examples like this and small changes to the input often potentially affect
very large parts of the output binaries. As a consequence, we had to make the
change detection system smarter and more accurate.</p>
<h2 id="improving-accuracy-the-red-green-algorithm"><a class="header" href="#improving-accuracy-the-red-green-algorithm">Improving Accuracy: The red-green Algorithm</a></h2>
<p>The &quot;false positives&quot; problem can be solved by interleaving change detection
and query re-evaluation. Instead of walking the graph all the way to the
inputs when trying to find out if some cached result is still valid, we can
check if a result has <em>actually</em> changed after we were forced to re-evaluate
it.</p>
<p>We call this algorithm the red-green algorithm because nodes
in the dependency graph are assigned the color green if we were able to prove
that its cached result is still valid and the color red if the result has
turned out to be different after re-evaluating it.</p>
<p>The meat of red-green change tracking is implemented in the try-mark-green
algorithm, that, you've guessed it, tries to mark a given node as green:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn try_mark_green(tcx, current_node) -&gt; bool {

    // Fetch the inputs to `current_node`, i.e. get the nodes that the direct
    // edges from `node` lead to.
    let dependencies = tcx.dep_graph.get_dependencies_of(current_node);

    // Now check all the inputs for changes
    for dependency in dependencies {

        match tcx.dep_graph.get_node_color(dependency) {
            Green =&gt; {
                // This input has already been checked before and it has not
                // changed; so we can go on to check the next one
            }
            Red =&gt; {
                // We found an input that has changed. We cannot mark
                // `current_node` as green without re-running the
                // corresponding query.
                return false
            }
            Unknown =&gt; {
                // This is the first time we look at this node. Let's try
                // to mark it green by calling try_mark_green() recursively.
                if try_mark_green(tcx, dependency) {
                    // We successfully marked the input as green, on to the
                    // next.

                    // We could *not* mark the input as green. This means we

<p>By using red-green marking we can avoid the devastating cumulative effect of
having false positives during change detection. Whenever a query is executed
in incremental mode, we first check if its already green. If not, we run
<code>try_mark_green()</code> on it. If it still isn't green after that, then we actually
invoke the query provider to re-compute the result.</p>
<h2 id="the-real-world-how-persistence-makes-everything-complicated"><a class="header" href="#the-real-world-how-persistence-makes-everything-complicated">The Real World: How Persistence Makes Everything Complicated</a></h2>
<p>The sections above described the underlying algorithm for incremental
compilation but because the compiler process exits after being finished and
takes the query context with its result cache with it into oblivion, we have to
persist data to disk, so the next compilation session can make use of it.
This comes with a whole new set of implementation challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>The query result cache is stored to disk, so they are not readily available
for change comparison.</li>
<li>A subsequent compilation session will start off with new version of the code
that has arbitrary changes applied to it. All kinds of IDs and indices that
are generated from a global, sequential counter (e.g. <code>NodeId</code>, <code>DefId</code>, etc)
might have shifted, making the persisted results on disk not immediately
usable anymore because the same numeric IDs and indices might refer to
completely new things in the new compilation session.</li>
<li>Persisting things to disk comes at a cost, so not every tiny piece of
information should be actually cached in between compilation sessions.
Fixed-sized, plain-old-data is preferred to complex things that need to run
through an expensive (de-)serialization step.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following sections describe how the compiler solves these issues.</p>
<h3 id="a-question-of-stability-bridging-the-gap-between-compilation-sessions"><a class="header" href="#a-question-of-stability-bridging-the-gap-between-compilation-sessions">A Question Of Stability: Bridging The Gap Between Compilation Sessions</a></h3>
<p>As noted before, various IDs (like <code>DefId</code>) are generated by the compiler in a
way that depends on the contents of the source code being compiled. ID assignment
is usually deterministic, that is, if the exact same code is compiled twice,
the same things will end up with the same IDs. However, if something
changes, e.g. a function is added in the middle of a file, there is no
guarantee that anything will have the same ID as it had before.</p>
<p>As a consequence we cannot represent the data in our on-disk cache the same
way it is represented in memory. For example, if we just stored a piece
of type information like <code>TyKind::FnDef(DefId, &amp;'tcx Substs&lt;'tcx&gt;)</code> (as we do
in memory) and then the contained <code>DefId</code> points to a different function in
a new compilation session we'd be in trouble.</p>
<p>The solution to this problem is to find &quot;stable&quot; forms for IDs which remain
valid in between compilation sessions. For the most important case, <code>DefId</code>s,
these are the so-called <code>DefPath</code>s. Each <code>DefId</code> has a
corresponding <code>DefPath</code> but in place of a numeric ID, a <code>DefPath</code> is based on
the path to the identified item, e.g. <code>std::collections::HashMap</code>. The
advantage of an ID like this is that it is not affected by unrelated changes.
For example, one can add a new function to <code>std::collections</code> but
<code>std::collections::HashMap</code> would still be <code>std::collections::HashMap</code>. A
<code>DefPath</code> is &quot;stable&quot; across changes made to the source code while a <code>DefId</code>
isn't.</p>
<p>There is also the <code>DefPathHash</code> which is just a 128-bit hash value of the
<code>DefPath</code>. The two contain the same information and we mostly use the
<code>DefPathHash</code> because it simpler to handle, being <code>Copy</code> and self-contained.</p>
<p>This principle of stable identifiers is used to make the data in the on-disk
cache resilient to source code changes. Instead of storing a <code>DefId</code>, we store
the <code>DefPathHash</code> and when we deserialize something from the cache, we map the
<code>DefPathHash</code> to the corresponding <code>DefId</code> in the <em>current</em> compilation session
(which is just a simple hash table lookup).</p>
<p>The <code>HirId</code>, used for identifying HIR components that don't have their own
<code>DefId</code>, is another such stable ID. It is (conceptually) a pair of a <code>DefPath</code>
and a <code>LocalId</code>, where the <code>LocalId</code> identifies something (e.g. a <code>hir::Expr</code>)
locally within its &quot;owner&quot; (e.g. a <code>hir::Item</code>). If the owner is moved around,
the <code>LocalId</code>s within it are still the same.</p>
<h3 id="checking-query-results-for-changes-hashstable-and-fingerprints"><a class="header" href="#checking-query-results-for-changes-hashstable-and-fingerprints">Checking Query Results For Changes: HashStable And Fingerprints</a></h3>
<p>In order to do red-green-marking we often need to check if the result of a
query has changed compared to the result it had during the previous
compilation session. There are two performance problems with this though:</p>
<ul>
<li>We'd like to avoid having to load the previous result from disk just for
doing the comparison. We already computed the new result and will use that.
Also loading a result from disk will &quot;pollute&quot; the interners with data that
is unlikely to ever be used.</li>
<li>We don't want to store each and every result in the on-disk cache. For
example, it would be wasted effort to persist things to disk that are
already available in upstream crates.</li>
</ul>
<p>The compiler avoids these problems by using so-called <code>Fingerprint</code>s. Each time
a new query result is computed, the query engine will compute a 128 bit hash
value of the result. We call this hash value &quot;the <code>Fingerprint</code> of the query
result&quot;. The hashing is (and has to be) done &quot;in a stable way&quot;. This means
that whenever something is hashed that might change in between compilation
sessions (e.g. a <code>DefId</code>), we instead hash its stable equivalent
(e.g. the corresponding <code>DefPath</code>). That's what the whole <code>HashStable</code>
infrastructure is for. This way <code>Fingerprint</code>s computed in two
different compilation sessions are still comparable.</p>
<p>The next step is to store these fingerprints along with the dependency graph.
This is cheap since fingerprints are just bytes to be copied. It's also cheap to
load the entire set of fingerprints together with the dependency graph.</p>
<p>Now, when red-green-marking reaches the point where it needs to check if a
result has changed, it can just compare the (already loaded) previous
fingerprint to the fingerprint of the new result.</p>
<p>This approach works rather well but it's not without flaws:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There is a small possibility of hash collisions. That is, two different
results could have the same fingerprint and the system would erroneously
assume that the result hasn't changed, leading to a missed update.</p>
<p>We mitigate this risk by using a high-quality hash function and a 128 bit
wide hash value. Due to these measures the practical risk of a hash
collision is negligible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Computing fingerprints is quite costly. It is the main reason why incremental
compilation can be slower than non-incremental compilation. We are forced to
use a good and thus expensive hash function, and we have to map things to
their stable equivalents while doing the hashing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="a-tale-of-two-depgraphs-the-old-and-the-new"><a class="header" href="#a-tale-of-two-depgraphs-the-old-and-the-new">A Tale Of Two DepGraphs: The Old And The New</a></h3>
<p>The initial description of dependency tracking glosses over a few details
that quickly become a head scratcher when actually trying to implement things.
In particular it's easy to overlook that we are actually dealing with <em>two</em>
dependency graphs: The one we built during the previous compilation session and
the one that we are building for the current compilation session.</p>
<p>When a compilation session starts, the compiler loads the previous dependency
graph into memory as an immutable piece of data. Then, when a query is invoked,
it will first try to mark the corresponding node in the graph as green. This
means really that we are trying to mark the node in the <em>previous</em> dep-graph
as green that corresponds to the query key in the <em>current</em> session. How do we
do this mapping between current query key and previous <code>DepNode</code>? The answer
is again <code>Fingerprint</code>s: Nodes in the dependency graph are identified by a
fingerprint of the query key. Since fingerprints are stable across compilation
sessions, computing one in the current session allows us to find a node
in the dependency graph from the previous session. If we don't find a node with
the given fingerprint, it means that the query key refers to something that
did not yet exist in the previous session.</p>
<p>So, having found the dep-node in the previous dependency graph, we can look
up its dependencies (i.e. also dep-nodes in the previous graph) and continue with
the rest of the try-mark-green algorithm. The next interesting thing happens
when we successfully marked the node as green. At that point we copy the node
and the edges to its dependencies from the old graph into the new graph. We
have to do this because the new dep-graph cannot acquire the
node and edges via the regular dependency tracking. The tracking system can
only record edges while actually running a query -- but running the query,
although we have the result already cached, is exactly what we want to avoid.</p>
<p>Once the compilation session has finished, all the unchanged parts have been
copied over from the old into the new dependency graph, while the changed parts
have been added to the new graph by the tracking system. At this point, the
new graph is serialized out to disk, alongside the query result cache, and can
act as the previous dep-graph in a subsequent compilation session.</p>
<h3 id="didnt-you-forget-something-cache-promotion"><a class="header" href="#didnt-you-forget-something-cache-promotion">Didn't You Forget Something?: Cache Promotion</a></h3>
<p>The system described so far has a somewhat subtle property: If all inputs of a
dep-node are green then the dep-node itself can be marked as green without
computing or loading the corresponding query result. Applying this property
transitively often leads to the situation that some intermediate results are
never actually loaded from disk, as in the following example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ignore">   input(A) &lt;-- intermediate_query(B) &lt;-- leaf_query(C)
</code></pre>
<p>The compiler might need the value of <code>leaf_query(C)</code> in order to generate some
output artifact. If it can mark <code>leaf_query(C)</code> as green, it will load the
result from the on-disk cache. The result of <code>intermediate_query(B)</code> is never
loaded though. As a consequence, when the compiler persists the <em>new</em> result
cache by writing all in-memory query results to disk, <code>intermediate_query(B)</code>
will not be in memory and thus will be missing from the new result cache.</p>
<p>If there subsequently is another compilation session that actually needs the
result of <code>intermediate_query(B)</code> it will have to be re-computed even though we
had a perfectly valid result for it in the cache just before.</p>
<p>In order to prevent this from happening, the compiler does something called
&quot;cache promotion&quot;: Before emitting the new result cache it will walk all green
dep-nodes and make sure that their query result is loaded into memory. That way
the result cache doesn't unnecessarily shrink again.</p>
<h1 id="incremental-compilation-and-the-compiler-backend"><a class="header" href="#incremental-compilation-and-the-compiler-backend">Incremental Compilation and the Compiler Backend</a></h1>
<p>The compiler backend, the part involving LLVM, is using the query system but
it is not implemented in terms of queries itself. As a consequence
it does not automatically partake in dependency tracking. However, the manual
integration with the tracking system is pretty straight-forward. The compiler
simply tracks what queries get invoked when generating the initial LLVM version
of each codegen unit, which results in a dep-node for each of them. In
subsequent compilation sessions it then tries to mark the dep-node for a CGU as
green. If it succeeds it knows that the corresponding object and bitcode files
on disk are still valid. If it doesn't succeed, the entire codegen unit has to
be recompiled.</p>
<p>This is the same approach that is used for regular queries. The main differences
are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>that we cannot easily compute a fingerprint for LLVM modules (because
they are opaque C++ objects),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that the logic for dealing with cached values is rather different from
regular queries because here we have bitcode and object files instead of
serialized Rust values in the common result cache file, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the operations around LLVM are so expensive in terms of computation time and
memory consumption that we need to have tight control over what is
executed when and what stays in memory for how long.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The query system could probably be extended with general purpose mechanisms to
deal with all of the above but so far that seemed like more trouble than it
would save.</p>
<h2 id="query-modifiers"><a class="header" href="#query-modifiers">Query Modifiers</a></h2>
<p>The query system allows for applying <a href="queries/../query.html#adding-a-new-kind-of-query">modifiers</a> to queries. These
modifiers affect certain aspects of how the system treats the query with
respect to incremental compilation:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>eval_always</code> - A query with the <code>eval_always</code> attribute is re-executed
unconditionally during incremental compilation. I.e. the system will not
even try to mark the query's dep-node as green. This attribute has two use
cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>eval_always</code> queries can read inputs (from files, global state, etc).
They can also produce side effects like writing to files and changing global state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some queries are very likely to be re-evaluated because their result
depends on the entire source code. In this case <code>eval_always</code> can be used
as an optimization because the system can skip recording dependencies in
the first place.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>no_hash</code> - Applying <code>no_hash</code> to a query tells the system to not compute
the fingerprint of the query's result. This has two consequences:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Not computing the fingerprint can save quite a bit of time because
fingerprinting is expensive, especially for large, complex values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Without the fingerprint, the system has to unconditionally assume that
the result of the query has changed. As a consequence anything depending
on a <code>no_hash</code> query will always be re-executed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Using <code>no_hash</code> for a query can make sense in two circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If the result of the query is very likely to change whenever one of its
inputs changes, e.g. a function like <code>|a, b, c| -&gt; (a * b * c)</code>. In such
a case recomputing the query will always yield a red node if one of the
inputs is red so we can spare us the trouble and default to red immediately.
A counter example would be a function like <code>|a| -&gt; (a == 42)</code> where the
result does not change for most changes of <code>a</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the result of a query is a big, monolithic collection (e.g. <code>index_hir</code>)
and there are &quot;projection queries&quot; reading from that collection
(e.g. <code>hir_owner</code>). In such a case the big collection will likely fulfill the
condition above (any changed input means recomputing the whole collection)
and the results of the projection queries will be hashed anyway. If we also
hashed the collection query it would mean that we effectively hash the same
data twice: once when hashing the collection and another time when hashing all
the projection query results. <code>no_hash</code> allows us to avoid that redundancy
and the projection queries act as a &quot;firewall&quot;, shielding their dependents
from the unconditionally red <code>no_hash</code> node.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>cache_on_disk_if</code> - This attribute is what determines which query results
are persisted in the incremental compilation query result cache. The
attribute takes an expression that allows per query invocation
decisions. For example, it makes no sense to store values from upstream
crates in the cache because they are already available in the upstream
crate's metadata.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>anon</code> - This attribute makes the system use &quot;anonymous&quot; dep-nodes for the
given query. An anonymous dep-node is not identified by the corresponding
query key, instead its ID is computed from the IDs of its dependencies. This
allows the red-green system to do its change detection even if there is no
query key available for a given dep-node -- something which is needed for
handling trait selection because it is not based on queries.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-projection-query-pattern"><a class="header" href="#the-projection-query-pattern">The Projection Query Pattern</a></h2>
<p>It's interesting to note that <code>eval_always</code> and <code>no_hash</code> can be used together
in the so-called &quot;projection query&quot; pattern. It is often the case that there is
one query that depends on the entirety of the compiler's input (e.g. the indexed HIR)
and another query that projects individual values out of this monolithic value
(e.g. a HIR item with a certain <code>DefId</code>). These projection queries allow for
building change propagation &quot;firewalls&quot; because even if the result of the
monolithic query changes (which it is very likely to do) the small projections
can still mostly be marked as green.</p>
<pre><code class="language-ignore">  +------------+
  |            |           +---------------+           +--------+
  |            | &lt;---------| projection(x) | &lt;---------| foo(a) |
  |            |           +---------------+           +--------+
  |            |
  | monolithic |           +---------------+           +--------+
  |   query    | &lt;---------| projection(y) | &lt;---------| bar(b) |
  |            |           +---------------+           +--------+
  |            |
  |            |           +---------------+           +--------+
  |            | &lt;---------| projection(z) | &lt;---------| baz(c) |
  |            |           +---------------+           +--------+
  +------------+
</code></pre>
<p>Let's assume that the result <code>monolithic_query</code> changes so that also the result
of <code>projection(x)</code> has changed, i.e. both their dep-nodes are being marked as
red. As a consequence <code>foo(a)</code> needs to be re-executed; but <code>bar(b)</code> and
<code>baz(c)</code> can be marked as green. However, if <code>foo</code>, <code>bar</code>, and <code>baz</code> would have
directly depended on <code>monolithic_query</code> then all of them would have had to be
re-evaluated.</p>
<p>This pattern works even without <code>eval_always</code> and <code>no_hash</code> but the two
modifiers can be used to avoid unnecessary overhead. If the monolithic query
is likely to change at any minor modification of the compiler's input it makes
sense to mark it as <code>eval_always</code>, thus getting rid of its dependency tracking
cost. And it always makes sense to mark the monolithic query as <code>no_hash</code>
because we have the projections to take care of keeping things green as much
as possible.</p>

<p>There are many things that still can be improved.</p>
<h2 id="incrementality-of-on-disk-data-structures"><a class="header" href="#incrementality-of-on-disk-data-structures">Incrementality of on-disk data structures</a></h2>
<p>The current system is not able to update on-disk caches and the dependency graph
in-place. Instead it has to rewrite each file entirely in each compilation
session. The overhead of doing so is a few percent of total compilation time.</p>
<h2 id="unnecessary-data-dependencies"><a class="header" href="#unnecessary-data-dependencies">Unnecessary data dependencies</a></h2>
<p>Data structures used as query results could be factored in a way that removes
edges from the dependency graph. Especially &quot;span&quot; information is very volatile,
so including it in query result will increase the chance that that result won't
be reusable. See <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/47389">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/47389</a> for more
information.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="debugging-and-testing-dependencies"><a class="header" href="#debugging-and-testing-dependencies">Debugging and Testing Dependencies</a></h1>
<h2 id="testing-the-dependency-graph"><a class="header" href="#testing-the-dependency-graph">Testing the dependency graph</a></h2>
<p>There are various ways to write tests against the dependency graph.
The simplest mechanisms are the <code>#[rustc_if_this_changed]</code> and
<code>#[rustc_then_this_would_need]</code> annotations. These are used in ui tests
to test whether the expected set of paths exist in the dependency graph.
As an example, see <code>tests/ui/dep-graph/dep-graph-caller-callee.rs</code>.</p>
<p>The idea is that you can annotate a test like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">#[rustc_if_this_changed]
fn foo() { }

#[rustc_then_this_would_need(TypeckTables)] //~ ERROR OK
fn bar() { foo(); }

#[rustc_then_this_would_need(TypeckTables)] //~ ERROR no path
fn baz() { }
</code></pre>
<p>This will check whether there is a path in the dependency graph from <code>Hir(foo)</code>
to <code>TypeckTables(bar)</code>. An error is reported for each
<code>#[rustc_then_this_would_need]</code> annotation that indicates whether a path
exists. <code>//~ ERROR</code> annotations can then be used to test if a path is found (as
demonstrated above).</p>
<h2 id="debugging-the-dependency-graph"><a class="header" href="#debugging-the-dependency-graph">Debugging the dependency graph</a></h2>
<h3 id="dumping-the-graph"><a class="header" href="#dumping-the-graph">Dumping the graph</a></h3>
<p>The compiler is also capable of dumping the dependency graph for your
debugging pleasure. To do so, pass the <code>-Z dump-dep-graph</code> flag. The
graph will be dumped to <code>dep_graph.{txt,dot}</code> in the current
directory.  You can override the filename with the <code>RUST_DEP_GRAPH</code>
environment variable.</p>
<p>Frequently, though, the full dep graph is quite overwhelming and not
particularly helpful. Therefore, the compiler also allows you to filter
the graph. You can filter in three ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>All edges originating in a particular set of nodes (usually a single node).</li>
<li>All edges reaching a particular set of nodes.</li>
<li>All edges that lie between given start and end nodes.</li>
</ol>
<p>To filter, use the <code>RUST_DEP_GRAPH_FILTER</code> environment variable, which should
look like one of the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">source_filter     // nodes originating from source_filter
-&gt; target_filter  // nodes that can reach target_filter
source_filter -&gt; target_filter // nodes in between source_filter and target_filter
</code></pre>
<p><code>source_filter</code> and <code>target_filter</code> are a <code>&amp;</code>-separated list of strings.
A node is considered to match a filter if all of those strings appear in its
label. So, for example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">RUST_DEP_GRAPH_FILTER='-&gt; TypeckTables'
</code></pre>
<p>would select the predecessors of all <code>TypeckTables</code> nodes. Usually though you
want the <code>TypeckTables</code> node for some particular fn, so you might write:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">RUST_DEP_GRAPH_FILTER='-&gt; TypeckTables &amp; bar'
</code></pre>
<p>This will select only the predecessors of <code>TypeckTables</code> nodes for functions
with <code>bar</code> in their name.</p>
<p>Perhaps you are finding that when you change <code>foo</code> you need to re-type-check
<code>bar</code>, but you don't think you should have to. In that case, you might do:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">RUST_DEP_GRAPH_FILTER='Hir &amp; foo -&gt; TypeckTables &amp; bar'
</code></pre>
<p>This will dump out all the nodes that lead from <code>Hir(foo)</code> to
<code>TypeckTables(bar)</code>, from which you can (hopefully) see the source
of the erroneous edge.</p>
<h3 id="tracking-down-incorrect-edges"><a class="header" href="#tracking-down-incorrect-edges">Tracking down incorrect edges</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes, after you dump the dependency graph, you will find some
path that should not exist, but you will not be quite sure how it came
to be. <strong>When the compiler is built with debug assertions,</strong> it can
help you track that down. Simply set the <code>RUST_FORBID_DEP_GRAPH_EDGE</code>
environment variable to a filter. Every edge created in the dep-graph
will be tested against that filter – if it matches, a <code>bug!</code> is
reported, so you can easily see the backtrace (<code>RUST_BACKTRACE=1</code>).</p>
<p>The syntax for these filters is the same as described in the previous
section. However, note that this filter is applied to every <strong>edge</strong>
and doesn't handle longer paths in the graph, unlike the previous
section.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>You find that there is a path from the <code>Hir</code> of <code>foo</code> to the type
check of <code>bar</code> and you don't think there should be. You dump the
dep-graph as described in the previous section and open <code>dep-graph.txt</code>
to see something like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Hir(foo) -&gt; Collect(bar)
Collect(bar) -&gt; TypeckTables(bar)
</code></pre>
<p>That first edge looks suspicious to you. So you set
<code>RUST_FORBID_DEP_GRAPH_EDGE</code> to <code>Hir&amp;foo -&gt; Collect&amp;bar</code>, re-run, and
then observe the backtrace. Voila, bug fixed!</p>

<p>This chapter is based on the explanation given by Niko Matsakis in this
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_muY4HjSqVw">video</a> about
<a href="https://github.com/salsa-rs/salsa">Salsa</a>. To find out more you may
want to watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_IhACacPRY">Salsa In More
Depth</a>, also by Niko
Matsakis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As of <!-- date-check --> November 2022, although Salsa is inspired by
(among other things) rustc's query system, it is not used directly in rustc.
It <em>is</em> used in chalk and extensively in <code>rust-analyzer</code>, but there are no
medium or long-term concrete plans to integrate it into the compiler.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="what-is-salsa"><a class="header" href="#what-is-salsa">What is Salsa?</a></h2>
<p>Salsa is a library for incremental recomputation. This means it allows reusing
computations that were already done in the past to increase the efficiency
of future computations.</p>
<p>The objectives of Salsa are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide that functionality in an automatic way, so reusing old computations
is done automatically by the library</li>
<li>Doing so in a &quot;sound&quot;, or &quot;correct&quot;, way, therefore leading to the same
results as if it had been done from scratch</li>
</ul>
<p>Salsa's actual model is much richer, allowing many kinds of inputs and many
different outputs.
For example, integrating Salsa with an IDE could mean that the inputs could be
the manifest (<code>Cargo.toml</code>), entire source files (<code>foo.rs</code>), snippets and so
on; the outputs of such an integration could range from a binary executable, to
lints, types (for example, if a user selects a certain variable and wishes to
see its type), completions, etc.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-it-work"><a class="header" href="#how-does-it-work">How does it work?</a></h2>
<p>The first thing that Salsa has to do is identify the &quot;base inputs&quot; that
are not something computed but given as input.</p>
<p>Then Salsa has to also identify intermediate, &quot;derived&quot; values, which are
something that the library produces, but, for each derived value there's a
&quot;pure&quot; function that computes the derived value.</p>
<p>For example, there might be a function <code>ast(x: Path) -&gt; AST</code>. The produced
<code>AST</code> isn't a final value, it's an intermediate value that the library would
use for the computation.</p>
<p>This means that when you try to compute with the library, Salsa is going to
compute various derived values, and eventually read the input and produce the
result for the asked computation.</p>
<p>In the course of computing, Salsa tracks which inputs were accessed and which
values are derived. This information is used to determine what's going to
happen when the inputs change: are the derived values still valid?</p>
<p>This doesn't necessarily mean that each computation downstream from the input
is going to be checked, which could be costly. Salsa only needs to check each
downstream computation until it finds one that isn't changed. At that point, it
won't check other derived computations since they wouldn't need to change.</p>
<p>It's helpful to think about this as a graph with nodes. Each derived value
has a dependency on other values, which could themselves be either base or
derived. Base values don't have a dependency.</p>
<pre><code class="language-ignore">I &lt;- A &lt;- C ...
          |
J &lt;- B &lt;--+
</code></pre>
<p>When an input <code>I</code> changes, the derived value <code>A</code> could change. The derived
value <code>B</code>, which does not depend on <code>I</code>, <code>A</code>, or any value derived from <code>A</code> or
<code>I</code>, is not subject to change.  Therefore, Salsa can reuse the computation done
for <code>B</code> in the past, without having to compute it again.</p>
<p>The computation could also terminate early. Keeping the same graph as before,
say that input <code>I</code> has changed in some way (and input <code>J</code> hasn't), but when
computing <code>A</code> again, it's found that <code>A</code> hasn't changed from the previous
computation. This leads to an &quot;early termination&quot;, because there's no need to
check if <code>C</code> needs to change, since both <code>C</code> direct inputs, <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>,
haven't changed.</p>
<h2 id="key-salsa-concepts"><a class="header" href="#key-salsa-concepts">Key Salsa concepts</a></h2>
<h3 id="query"><a class="header" href="#query">Query</a></h3>
<p>A query is some value that Salsa can access in the course of computation.  Each
query can have a number of keys (from 0 to many), and all queries have a
result, akin to functions.  0-key queries are called &quot;input&quot; queries.</p>
<h3 id="database"><a class="header" href="#database">Database</a></h3>
<p>The database is basically the context for the entire computation, it's meant to
store Salsa's internal state, all intermediate values for each query, and
anything else that the computation might need.  The database must know all the
queries that the library is going to do before it can be built, but they don't
need to be specified in the same place.</p>
<p>After the database is formed, it can be accessed with queries that are very
similar to functions.  Since each query's result is stored in the database,
when a query is invoked N times, it will return N <strong>cloned</strong> results, without
having to recompute the query (unless the input has changed in such a way that
it warrants recomputation).</p>
<p>For each input query (0-key), a &quot;set&quot; method is generated, allowing the user to
change the output of such query, and trigger previous memoized values to be
potentially invalidated.</p>
<h3 id="query-groups"><a class="header" href="#query-groups">Query Groups</a></h3>
<p>A query group is a set of queries which have been defined together as a unit.
The database is formed by combining query groups. Query groups are akin to
&quot;Salsa modules&quot;.</p>
<p>A set of queries in a query group are just a set of methods in a trait.</p>
<p>To create a query group a trait annotated with a specific attribute
(<code>#[salsa::query_group(...)]</code>) has to be created.</p>
<p>An argument must also be provided to said attribute as it will be used by Salsa
to create a struct to be used later when the database is created.</p>
<p>Example input query group:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">/// This attribute will process this tree, produce this tree as output, and produce
/// a bunch of intermediate stuff that Salsa also uses.  One of these things is a
/// &quot;StorageStruct&quot;, whose name we have specified in the attribute.
///
/// This query group is a bunch of **input** queries, that do not rely on any
/// derived input.
#[salsa::query_group(InputsStorage)]
pub trait Inputs {
    /// This attribute (`#[salsa::input]`) indicates that this query is a base
    /// input, therefore `set_manifest` is going to be auto-generated
    #[salsa::input]
    fn manifest(&amp;self) -&gt; Manifest;

    #[salsa::input]
    fn source_text(&amp;self, name: String) -&gt; String;
}
</code></pre>
<p>To create a <strong>derived</strong> query group, one must specify which other query groups
this one depends on by specifying them as supertraits, as seen in the following
example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">/// This query group is going to contain queries that depend on derived values a
/// query group can access another query group's queries by specifying the
/// dependency as a super trait query groups can be stacked as much as needed using
/// that pattern.
#[salsa::query_group(ParserStorage)]
pub trait Parser: Inputs {
    /// This query `ast` is not an input query, it's a derived query this means
    /// that a definition is necessary.
    fn ast(&amp;self, name: String) -&gt; String;
}
</code></pre>
<p>When creating a derived query the implementation of said query must be defined
outside the trait.  The definition must take a database parameter as an <code>impl Trait</code> (or <code>dyn Trait</code>), where <code>Trait</code> is the query group that the definition
belongs to, in addition to the other keys.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">///This is going to be the definition of the `ast` query in the `Parser` trait.
///So, when the query `ast` is invoked, and it needs to be recomputed, Salsa is going to call this function
///and it's is going to give it the database as `impl Parser`.
///The function doesn't need to be aware of all the queries of all the query groups
fn ast(db: &amp;impl Parser, name: String) -&gt; String {
    //! Note, `impl Parser` is used here but `dyn Parser` works just as well
    /* code */
    ///By passing an `impl Parser`, this is allowed
    let source_text = db.input_file(name);
    /* do the actual parsing */
    return ast;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Eventually, after all the query groups have been defined, the database can be
created by declaring a struct.</p>
<p>To specify which query groups are going to be part of the database an attribute
(<code>#[salsa::database(...)]</code>) must be added. The argument of said attribute is a
list of identifiers, specifying the query groups <strong>storages</strong>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">///This attribute specifies which query groups are going to be in the database
#[salsa::database(InputsStorage, ParserStorage)]
#[derive(Default)] //optional!
struct MyDatabase {
    ///You also need this one field
    runtime : salsa::Runtime&lt;MyDatabase&gt;,
}
///And this trait has to be implemented
impl salsa::Database for MyDatabase {
    fn salsa_runtime(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;salsa::Runtime&lt;MyDatabase&gt; {
        &amp;self.runtime
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Example usage:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn main() {
    let db = MyDatabase::default();
    db.set_manifest(...);
    db.set_source_text(...);
    loop {
        db.ast(...); //will reuse results
        db.set_source_text(...);
    }

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="memory-management-in-rustc"><a class="header" href="#memory-management-in-rustc">Memory Management in Rustc</a></h1>
<p>Rustc tries to be pretty careful how it manages memory. The compiler allocates
<em>a lot</em> of data structures throughout compilation, and if we are not careful,
it will take a lot of time and space to do so.</p>
<p>One of the main way the compiler manages this is using arenas and interning.</p>
<h2 id="arenas-and--interning"><a class="header" href="#arenas-and--interning">Arenas and  Interning</a></h2>
<p>We create a LOT of data structures during compilation. For performance reasons,
we allocate them from a global memory pool; they are each allocated once from a
long-lived <em>arena</em>. This is called <em>arena allocation</em>. This system reduces
allocations/deallocations of memory. It also allows for easy comparison of
types for equality: for each interned type <code>X</code>, we implemented <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/struct.Ty.html#implementations"><code>PartialEq for X</code></a>, so we can just compare pointers. The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/struct.CtxtInterners.html#structfield.arena"><code>CtxtInterners</code></a> type
contains a bunch of maps of interned types and the arena itself.</p>
<h3 id="example-tytykind"><a class="header" href="#example-tytykind">Example: <code>ty::TyKind</code></a></h3>
<p>Taking the example of <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/sty/type.TyKind.html"><code>ty::TyKind</code></a> which represents a type in the compiler (you
can read more <a href="./ty.html">here</a>).  Each time we want to construct a type, the
compiler doesn’t naively allocate from the buffer.  Instead, we check if that
type was already constructed. If it was, we just get the same pointer we had
before, otherwise we make a fresh pointer. With this schema if we want to know
if two types are the same, all we need to do is compare the pointers which is
efficient. <code>TyKind</code> should never be constructed on the stack, and it would be unusable
if done so.
You always allocate them from this arena and you always intern them so they are
unique.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the compilation we make a buffer and each time we need to allocate a type we use
some of this memory buffer. If we run out of space we get another one. The lifetime of that buffer
is <code>'tcx</code>. Our types are tied to that lifetime, so when compilation finishes all the memory related
to that buffer is freed and our <code>'tcx</code> references would be invalid.</p>
<p>In addition to types, there are a number of other arena-allocated data structures that you can
allocate, and which are found in this module. Here are a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="./generic_arguments.html#subst"><code>Substs</code></a>, allocated with <code>mk_substs</code> – this will intern a slice of types, often used to
specify the values to be substituted for generics (e.g. <code>HashMap&lt;i32, u32&gt;</code> would be represented
as a slice <code>&amp;'tcx [tcx.types.i32, tcx.types.u32]</code>).</li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/struct.TraitRef.html"><code>TraitRef</code></a>, typically passed by value – a <strong>trait reference</strong> consists of a reference to a trait
along with its various type parameters (including <code>Self</code>), like <code>i32: Display</code> (here, the def-id
would reference the <code>Display</code> trait, and the substs would contain <code>i32</code>). Note that <code>def-id</code> is
defined and discussed in depth in the <code>AdtDef and DefId</code> section.</li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/struct.Predicate.html"><code>Predicate</code></a> defines something the trait system has to prove (see <code>traits</code> module).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-tcx-and-how-it-uses-lifetimes"><a class="header" href="#the-tcx-and-how-it-uses-lifetimes">The tcx and how it uses lifetimes</a></h2>
<p>The <code>tcx</code> (&quot;typing context&quot;) is the central data structure in the compiler. It is the context that
you use to perform all manner of queries. The struct <code>TyCtxt</code> defines a reference to this shared
context:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">tcx: TyCtxt&lt;'tcx&gt;
//          ----
//          |
//          arena lifetime
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, the <code>TyCtxt</code> type takes a lifetime parameter. When you see a reference with a
lifetime like <code>'tcx</code>, you know that it refers to arena-allocated data (or data that lives as long as
the arenas, anyhow).</p>
<h3 id="a-note-on-lifetimes"><a class="header" href="#a-note-on-lifetimes">A Note On Lifetimes</a></h3>
<p>The Rust compiler is a fairly large program containing lots of big data
structures (e.g. the AST, HIR, and the type system) and as such, arenas and
references are heavily relied upon to minimize unnecessary memory use. This
manifests itself in the way people can plug into the compiler (i.e. the
<a href="./rustc-driver.html">driver</a>), preferring a &quot;push&quot;-style API (callbacks) instead
of the more Rust-ic &quot;pull&quot; style (think the <code>Iterator</code> trait).</p>
<p>Thread-local storage and interning are used a lot through the compiler to reduce
duplication while also preventing a lot of the ergonomic issues due to many
pervasive lifetimes. The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/tls/index.html"><code>rustc_middle::ty::tls</code></a> module is used to access these
thread-locals, although you should rarely need to touch it.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="serialization-in-rustc"><a class="header" href="#serialization-in-rustc">Serialization in Rustc</a></h1>
<p>Rustc has to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization">serialize</a> and deserialize various data during compilation.
Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Crate metadata&quot;, mainly query outputs, are serialized in a binary
format into <code>rlib</code> and <code>rmeta</code> files that are output when compiling a library
crate, these are then deserialized by crates that depend on that library.</li>
<li>Certain query outputs are serialized in a binary format to
<a href="queries/incremental-compilation-in-detail.html#the-real-world-how-persistence-makes-everything-complicated">persist incremental compilation results</a>.</li>
<li>The <code>-Z ast-json</code> and <code>-Z ast-json-noexpand</code> flags serialize the <a href="the-parser.html">AST</a> to json
and output the result to stdout.</li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_codegen_ssa/struct.CrateInfo.html"><code>CrateInfo</code></a> is serialized to json when the <code>-Z no-link</code> flag is used, and
deserialized from json when the <code>-Z link-only</code> flag is used.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-encodable-and-decodable-traits"><a class="header" href="#the-encodable-and-decodable-traits">The <code>Encodable</code> and <code>Decodable</code> traits</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_serialize/index.html"><code>rustc_serialize</code></a> crate defines two traits for types which can be serialized:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub trait Encodable&lt;S: Encoder&gt; {
    fn encode(&amp;self, s: &amp;mut S) -&gt; Result&lt;(), S::Error&gt;;
}

pub trait Decodable&lt;D: Decoder&gt;: Sized {
    fn decode(d: &amp;mut D) -&gt; Result&lt;Self, D::Error&gt;;
}
</code></pre>
<p>It also defines implementations of these for integer types, floating point
types, <code>bool</code>, <code>char</code>, <code>str</code> and various common standard library types.</p>
<p>For types that are constructed from those types, <code>Encodable</code> and <code>Decodable</code> are
usually implemented by <a href="serialization.html#derive-macros">derives</a>. These generate implementations that forward
deserialization to the fields of the struct or enum. For a struct those impls
look something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">#![feature(rustc_private)]
extern crate rustc_serialize;
use rustc_serialize::{Decodable, Decoder, Encodable, Encoder};

struct MyStruct {
    int: u32,
    float: f32,
}

impl&lt;E: Encoder&gt; Encodable&lt;E&gt; for MyStruct {
    fn encode(&amp;self, s: &amp;mut E) -&gt; Result&lt;(), E::Error&gt; {
        s.emit_struct(&quot;MyStruct&quot;, 2, |s| {
            s.emit_struct_field(&quot;int&quot;, 0, |s| self.int.encode(s))?;
            s.emit_struct_field(&quot;float&quot;, 1, |s| self.float.encode(s))
        })
    }
}
impl&lt;D: Decoder&gt; Decodable&lt;D&gt; for MyStruct {
    fn decode(s: &amp;mut D) -&gt; Result&lt;MyStruct, D::Error&gt; {
        s.read_struct(&quot;MyStruct&quot;, 2, |d| {
            let int = d.read_struct_field(&quot;int&quot;, 0, Decodable::decode)?;
            let float = d.read_struct_field(&quot;float&quot;, 1, Decodable::decode)?;

            Ok(MyStruct { int, float })
        })
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="encoding-and-decoding-arena-allocated-types"><a class="header" href="#encoding-and-decoding-arena-allocated-types">Encoding and Decoding arena allocated types</a></h2>
<p>Rustc has a lot of <a href="memory.html">arena allocated types</a>. Deserializing these types isn't
possible without access to the arena that they need to be allocated on. The
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/codec/trait.TyDecoder.html"><code>TyDecoder</code></a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/codec/trait.TyEncoder.html"><code>TyEncoder</code></a> traits are supertraits of <code>Decoder</code> and
<code>Encoder</code> that allow access to a <code>TyCtxt</code>.</p>
<p>Types which contain arena allocated types can then bound the type parameter of
their <code>Encodable</code> and <code>Decodable</code> implementations with these traits. For
example</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">impl&lt;'tcx, D: TyDecoder&lt;'tcx&gt;&gt; Decodable&lt;D&gt; for MyStruct&lt;'tcx&gt; {
    /* ... */
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>TyEncodable</code> and <code>TyDecodable</code> <a href="serialization.html#derive-macros">derive macros</a> will expand to such
an implementation.</p>
<p>Decoding the actual arena allocated type is harder, because some of the
implementations can't be written due to the orphan rules. To work around this,
the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/codec/trait.RefDecodable.html"><code>RefDecodable</code></a> trait is defined in <code>rustc_middle</code>. This can then be
implemented for any type. The <code>TyDecodable</code> macro will call <code>RefDecodable</code> to
decode references, but various generic code needs types to actually be
<code>Decodable</code> with a specific decoder.</p>
<p>For interned types instead of manually implementing <code>RefDecodable</code>, using a new
type wrapper, like <code>ty::Predicate</code> and manually implementing <code>Encodable</code> and
<code>Decodable</code> may be simpler.</p>
<h2 id="derive-macros"><a class="header" href="#derive-macros">Derive macros</a></h2>
<p>The <code>rustc_macros</code> crate defines various derives to help implement <code>Decodable</code>
and <code>Encodable</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>Encodable</code> and <code>Decodable</code> macros generate implementations that apply to
all <code>Encoders</code> and <code>Decoders</code>. These should be used in crates that don't
depend on <code>rustc_middle</code>, or that have to be serialized by a type that does
not implement <code>TyEncoder</code>.</li>
<li><code>MetadataEncodable</code> and <code>MetadataDecodable</code> generate implementations that
only allow decoding by <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_metadata/rmeta/encoder/struct.EncodeContext.html"><code>rustc_metadata::rmeta::encoder::EncodeContext</code></a> and
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_metadata/rmeta/decoder/struct.DecodeContext.html"><code>rustc_metadata::rmeta::decoder::DecodeContext</code></a>. These are used for types
that contain <code>rustc_metadata::rmeta::Lazy</code>.</li>
<li><code>TyEncodable</code> and <code>TyDecoder</code> generate implementation that apply to any
<code>TyEncoder</code> or <code>TyDecoder</code>. These should be used for types that are only
serialized in crate metadata and/or the incremental cache, which is most
serializable types in <code>rustc_middle</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="shorthands"><a class="header" href="#shorthands">Shorthands</a></h2>
<p><code>Ty</code> can be deeply recursive, if each <code>Ty</code> was encoded naively then crate
metadata would be very large. To handle this, each <code>TyEncoder</code> has a cache of
locations in its output where it has serialized types. If a type being encoded
is in the cache, then instead of serializing the type as usual, the byte offset
within the file being written is encoded instead. A similar scheme is used for
<code>ty::Predicate</code>.</p>
<h2 id="lazyvaluet"><a class="header" href="#lazyvaluet"><code>LazyValue&lt;T&gt;</code></a></h2>
<p>Crate metadata is initially loaded before the <code>TyCtxt&lt;'tcx&gt;</code> is created, so
some deserialization needs to be deferred from the initial loading of metadata.
The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_metadata/rmeta/struct.LazyValue.html"><code>LazyValue&lt;T&gt;</code></a> type wraps the (relative) offset in the crate metadata where a
<code>T</code> has been serialized. There are also some variants, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_metadata/rmeta/struct.LazyValue.html"><code>LazyArray&lt;T&gt;</code></a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_metadata/rmeta/struct.LazyValue.html"><code>LazyTable&lt;I, T&gt;</code></a>.</p>
<p>The <code>Lazy&lt;[T]&gt;</code> and <code>LazyTable&lt;I, T&gt;</code> type provide some functionality over
<code>Lazy&lt;Vec&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> and <code>Lazy&lt;HashMap&lt;I, T&gt;&gt;</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's possible to encode a <code>LazyArray&lt;T&gt;</code> directly from an iterator, without
first collecting into a <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>Indexing into a <code>LazyTable&lt;I, T&gt;</code> does not require decoding entries other
than the one being read.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>note</strong>: <code>LazyValue&lt;T&gt;</code> does not cache its value after being deserialized the first
time. Instead the query system is the main way of caching these results.</p>
<h2 id="specialization"><a class="header" href="#specialization">Specialization</a></h2>
<p>A few types, most notably <code>DefId</code>, need to have different implementations for
different <code>Encoder</code>s. This is currently handled by ad-hoc specializations:
<code>DefId</code> has a <code>default</code> implementation of <code>Encodable&lt;E&gt;</code> and a specialized one
for <code>Encodable&lt;CacheEncoder&gt;</code>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="parallel-compilation"><a class="header" href="#parallel-compilation">Parallel Compilation</a></h1>
<p>As of <!-- date-check --> August 2022, the only stage of the compiler that 
is already parallel is codegen. Some parts of the compiler already have 
parallel implementations, such as query evaluation, type check and 
monomorphization, but the general version of the compiler does not include 
these parallelization functions. <strong>To try out the current parallel compiler</strong>, 
one can install rustc from source code with <code>parallel-compiler = true</code> in 
the <code>config.toml</code>.</p>
<p>The lack of parallelism at other stages (for example, macro expansion) also 
represents an opportunity for improving compiler performance.</p>

<h2 id="codegen"><a class="header" href="#codegen">Codegen</a></h2>
<p>During <a href="backend/monomorph.html">monomorphization</a> the compiler splits up all the code to

independent instances of LLVM running in parallel. At the end, the linker
is run to combine all the codegen units together into one binary. This process
occurs in the <code>rustc_codegen_ssa::base</code> module.</p>

<p>These thread-safe data structures interspersed during compilation can 
cause a lot of lock contention, which actually degrades performance as the
number of threads increases beyond 4. This inspires us to audit the use 
of these data structures, leading to either refactoring to reduce use of 
shared state, or persistent documentation covering invariants, atomicity, 
and lock orderings.</p>

<p>There are still many loops that have the potential to use parallel iterators.</p>
<h2 id="query-system"><a class="header" href="#query-system">Query System</a></h2>
<p>The query model has some properties that make it actually feasible to evaluate
multiple queries in parallel without too much of an effort:</p>
<ul>
<li>All data a query provider can access is accessed via the query context, so
the query context can take care of synchronizing access.</li>
<li>Query results are required to be immutable so they can safely be used by
different threads concurrently.</li>
</ul>
<p>When a query <code>foo</code> is evaluated, the cache table for <code>foo</code> is locked.</p>
<ul>
<li>If there already is a result, we can clone it, release the lock and
we are done.</li>
<li>If there is no cache entry and no other active query invocation computing the
same result, we mark the key as being &quot;in progress&quot;, release the lock and
start evaluating.</li>
<li>If there <em>is</em> another query invocation for the same key in progress, we
release the lock, and just block the thread until the other invocation has
computed the result we are waiting for. <strong>Cycle error detection</strong> in the parallel 
compiler requires more complex logic than in single-threaded mode. When 
worker threads in parallel queries stop making progress due to interdependence, 
the compiler uses an extra thread <em>(named deadlock handler)</em> to detect, remove and 
report the cycle error.</li>
</ul>
<p>Parallel query still has a lot of work to do, most of which is related to 
the previous <code>Data Structures</code> and <code>Parallel Iterators</code>. See <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/48685">this tracking issue</a>.</p>

<p>This page describes rustdoc's passes and modes. For an overview of rustdoc,
see the <a href="./rustdoc.html">&quot;Rustdoc overview&quot; chapter</a>.</p>
<h2 id="from-crate-to-clean"><a class="header" href="#from-crate-to-clean">From crate to clean</a></h2>
<p>In <code>core.rs</code> are two central items: the <code>DocContext</code> struct, and the <code>run_core</code>
function. The latter is where rustdoc calls out to rustc to compile a crate to
the point where rustdoc can take over. The former is a state container used
when crawling through a crate to gather its documentation.</p>
<p>The main process of crate crawling is done in <code>clean/mod.rs</code> through several
implementations of the <code>Clean</code> trait defined within. This is a conversion
trait, which defines one method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub trait Clean&lt;T&gt; {
    fn clean(&amp;self, cx: &amp;DocContext) -&gt; T;
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>clean/mod.rs</code> also defines the types for the &quot;cleaned&quot; AST used later on to
render documentation pages. Each usually accompanies an implementation of
<code>Clean</code> that takes some AST or HIR type from rustc and converts it into the
appropriate &quot;cleaned&quot; type. &quot;Big&quot; items like modules or associated items may
have some extra processing in its <code>Clean</code> implementation, but for the most part
these impls are straightforward conversions. The &quot;entry point&quot; to this module
is the <code>impl Clean&lt;Crate&gt; for visit_ast::RustdocVisitor</code>, which is called by
<code>run_core</code> above.</p>
<p>You see, I actually lied a little earlier: There's another AST transformation
that happens before the events in <code>clean/mod.rs</code>. In <code>visit_ast.rs</code> is the
type <code>RustdocVisitor</code>, which <em>actually</em> crawls a <code>rustc_hir::Crate</code> to get the first
intermediate representation, defined in <code>doctree.rs</code>. This pass is mainly to
get a few intermediate wrappers around the HIR types and to process visibility
and inlining. This is where <code>#[doc(inline)]</code>, <code>#[doc(no_inline)]</code>, and
<code>#[doc(hidden)]</code> are processed, as well as the logic for whether a <code>pub use</code>
should get the full page or a &quot;Reexport&quot; line in the module page.</p>
<p>The other major thing that happens in <code>clean/mod.rs</code> is the collection of doc
comments and <code>#[doc=&quot;&quot;]</code> attributes into a separate field of the Attributes
struct, present on anything that gets hand-written documentation. This makes it
easier to collect this documentation later in the process.</p>
<p>The primary output of this process is a <code>clean::Crate</code> with a tree of Items
which describe the publicly-documentable items in the target crate.</p>
<h3 id="hot-potato"><a class="header" href="#hot-potato">Hot potato</a></h3>
<p>Before moving on to the next major step, a few important &quot;passes&quot; occur over
the documentation. These do things like combine the separate &quot;attributes&quot; into
a single string to make the document easier on the markdown parser,
or drop items that are not public or deliberately hidden with <code>#[doc(hidden)]</code>.
These are all implemented in the <code>passes/</code> directory, one file per pass.
By default, all of these passes are run on a crate, but the ones
regarding dropping private/hidden items can be bypassed by passing
<code>--document-private-items</code> to rustdoc. Note that unlike the previous set of AST
transformations, the passes are run on the <em>cleaned</em> crate.</p>
<p>(Strictly speaking, you can fine-tune the passes run and even add your own, but
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/44136">we're trying to deprecate that</a>. If you need finer-grain control over
these passes, please let us know!)</p>
<p>Here is the list of passes as of <!-- date-check --> November 2022:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>calculate-doc-coverage</code> calculates information used for the <code>--show-coverage</code>
flag.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>check-bare-urls</code> detects links that are not linkified, e.g., in Markdown such as
<code>Go to https://example.com/.</code> It suggests wrapping the link with angle brackets:
<code>Go to &lt;https://example.com/&gt;.</code> to linkify it. This is the code behind the <!--
  date: 2022-05 --> <code>rustdoc::bare_urls</code> lint.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>check-code-block-syntax</code> validates syntax inside Rust code blocks
(<code>```rust</code>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>check-doc-test-visibility</code> runs doctest visibility–related lints.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>check-invalid-html-tags</code> detects invalid HTML (like an unclosed <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>)
in doc comments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>collect-intra-doc-links</code> resolves <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustdoc/write-documentation/linking-to-items-by-name.html">intra-doc links</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>collect-trait-impls</code> collects trait impls for each item in the crate. For
example, if we define a struct that implements a trait, this pass will note
that the struct implements that trait.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>propagate-doc-cfg</code> propagates <code>#[doc(cfg(...))]</code> to child items.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>strip-priv-imports</code> strips all private import statements (<code>use</code>, <code>extern crate</code>) from a crate. This is necessary because rustdoc will handle <em>public</em>
imports by either inlining the item's documentation to the module or creating
a &quot;Reexports&quot; section with the import in it. The pass ensures that all of
these imports are actually relevant to documentation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>strip-hidden</code> and <code>strip-private</code> strip all <code>doc(hidden)</code> and private items
from the output. <code>strip-private</code> implies <code>strip-priv-imports</code>. Basically, the
goal is to remove items that are not relevant for public documentation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There is also a <code>stripper</code> module in <code>passes/</code>, but it is a collection of
utility functions for the <code>strip-*</code> passes and is not a pass itself.</p>
<h2 id="from-clean-to-crate"><a class="header" href="#from-clean-to-crate">From clean to crate</a></h2>
<p>This is where the &quot;second phase&quot; in rustdoc begins. This phase primarily lives
in the <code>html/</code> folder, and it all starts with <code>run()</code> in <code>html/render.rs</code>. This
code is responsible for setting up the <code>Context</code>, <code>SharedContext</code>, and <code>Cache</code>
which are used during rendering, copying out the static files which live in
every rendered set of documentation (things like the fonts, CSS, and JavaScript
that live in <code>html/static/</code>), creating the search index, and printing out the
source code rendering, before beginning the process of rendering all the
documentation for the crate.</p>
<p>Several functions implemented directly on <code>Context</code> take the <code>clean::Crate</code> and
set up some state between rendering items or recursing on a module's child
items. From here the &quot;page rendering&quot; begins, via an enormous <code>write!()</code> call
in <code>html/layout.rs</code>. The parts that actually generate HTML from the items and
documentation occurs within a series of <code>std::fmt::Display</code> implementations and
functions that pass around a <code>&amp;mut std::fmt::Formatter</code>. The top-level
implementation that writes out the page body is the <code>impl&lt;'a&gt; fmt::Display for Item&lt;'a&gt;</code> in <code>html/render.rs</code>, which switches out to one of several <code>item_*</code>
functions based on the kind of <code>Item</code> being rendered.</p>
<p>Depending on what kind of rendering code you're looking for, you'll probably
find it either in <code>html/render.rs</code> for major items like &quot;what sections should I
print for a struct page&quot; or <code>html/format.rs</code> for smaller component pieces like
&quot;how should I print a where clause as part of some other item&quot;.</p>
<p>Whenever rustdoc comes across an item that should print hand-written
documentation alongside, it calls out to <code>html/markdown.rs</code> which interfaces
with the Markdown parser. This is exposed as a series of types that wrap a
string of Markdown, and implement <code>fmt::Display</code> to emit HTML text. It takes
special care to enable certain features like footnotes and tables and add
syntax highlighting to Rust code blocks (via <code>html/highlight.rs</code>) before
running the Markdown parser. There's also a function in here
(<code>find_testable_code</code>) that specifically scans for Rust code blocks so the
test-runner code can find all the doctests in the crate.</p>
<h3 id="from-soup-to-nuts"><a class="header" href="#from-soup-to-nuts">From soup to nuts</a></h3>
<p>(alternate title: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOLAGYmUQV0">&quot;An unbroken thread that stretches from those first <code>Cell</code>s
to us&quot;</a>)</p>
<p>It's important to note that the AST cleaning can ask the compiler for
information (crucially, <code>DocContext</code> contains a <code>TyCtxt</code>), but page rendering
cannot. The <code>clean::Crate</code> created within <code>run_core</code> is passed outside the
compiler context before being handed to <code>html::render::run</code>. This means that a
lot of the &quot;supplementary data&quot; that isn't immediately available inside an
item's definition, like which trait is the <code>Deref</code> trait used by the language,
needs to be collected during cleaning, stored in the <code>DocContext</code>, and passed
along to the <code>SharedContext</code> during HTML rendering.  This manifests as a bunch
of shared state, context variables, and <code>RefCell</code>s.</p>
<p>Also of note is that some items that come from &quot;asking the compiler&quot; don't go
directly into the <code>DocContext</code> - for example, when loading items from a foreign
crate, rustdoc will ask about trait implementations and generate new <code>Item</code>s
for the impls based on that information. This goes directly into the returned
<code>Crate</code> rather than roundabout through the <code>DocContext</code>. This way, these
implementations can be collected alongside the others, right before rendering
the HTML.</p>
<h2 id="other-tricks-up-its-sleeve"><a class="header" href="#other-tricks-up-its-sleeve">Other tricks up its sleeve</a></h2>
<p>All this describes the process for generating HTML documentation from a Rust
crate, but there are couple other major modes that rustdoc runs in. It can also
be run on a standalone Markdown file, or it can run doctests on Rust code or
standalone Markdown files. For the former, it shortcuts straight to
<code>html/markdown.rs</code>, optionally including a mode which inserts a Table of
Contents to the output HTML.</p>
<p>For the latter, rustdoc runs a similar partial-compilation to get relevant
documentation in <code>test.rs</code>, but instead of going through the full clean and
render process, it runs a much simpler crate walk to grab <em>just</em> the
hand-written documentation. Combined with the aforementioned
&quot;<code>find_testable_code</code>&quot; in <code>html/markdown.rs</code>, it builds up a collection of
tests to run before handing them off to the test runner. One notable
location in <code>test.rs</code> is the function <code>make_test</code>, which is where hand-written
doctests get transformed into something that can be executed.</p>
<p>Some extra reading about <code>make_test</code> can be found
<a href="https://quietmisdreavus.net/code/2018/02/23/how-the-doctests-get-made/">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="dotting-is-and-crossing-ts"><a class="header" href="#dotting-is-and-crossing-ts">Dotting i's and crossing t's</a></h2>
<p>So that's rustdoc's code in a nutshell, but there's more things in the repo
that deal with it. Since we have the full <code>compiletest</code> suite at hand, there's
a set of tests in <code>tests/rustdoc</code> that make sure the final HTML is what we
expect in various situations. These tests also use a supplementary script,
<code>src/etc/htmldocck.py</code>, that allows it to look through the final HTML using
XPath notation to get a precise look at the output. The full description of all
the commands available to rustdoc tests (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/etc/htmldocck.py#L39"><code>@has</code></a> and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/etc/htmldocck.py#L44"><code>@matches</code></a>) is in
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/etc/htmldocck.py"><code>htmldocck.py</code></a>.</p>
<p>To use multiple crates in a rustdoc test, add <code>// aux-build:filename.rs</code>
to the top of the test file. <code>filename.rs</code> should be placed in an <code>auxiliary</code>
directory relative to the test file with the comment. If you need to build
docs for the auxiliary file, use <code>// build-aux-docs</code>.</p>
<p>In addition, there are separate tests for the search index and rustdoc's
ability to query it. The files in <code>tests/rustdoc-js</code> each contain a
different search query and the expected results, broken out by search tab.
These files are processed by a script in <code>src/tools/rustdoc-js</code> and the Node.js
runtime. These tests don't have as thorough of a writeup, but a broad example
that features results in all tabs can be found in <code>basic.js</code>. The basic idea is
that you match a given <code>QUERY</code> with a set of <code>EXPECTED</code> results, complete with
the full item path of each item.</p>
<h2 id="testing-locally"><a class="header" href="#testing-locally">Testing locally</a></h2>
<p>Some features of the generated HTML documentation might require local
storage to be used across pages, which doesn't work well without an HTTP
server. To test these features locally, you can run a local HTTP server, like
this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ ./x.py doc library
# The documentation has been generated into `build/[YOUR ARCH]/doc`.
$ python3 -m http.server -d build/[YOUR ARCH]/doc
</code></pre>
<p>Now you can browse your documentation just like you would if it was hosted
on the internet. For example, the url for <code>std</code> will be `/std/&quot;.</p>

<p>This part describes the process of taking raw source code from the user and
transforming it into various forms that the compiler can work with easily.
These are called <em>intermediate representations (IRs)</em>.</p>
<p>This process starts with compiler understanding what the user has asked for:
parsing the command line arguments given and determining what it is to compile.
After that, the compiler transforms the user input into a series of IRs that
look progressively less like what the user wrote.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="command-line-arguments"><a class="header" href="#command-line-arguments">Command-line Arguments</a></h1>
<p>Command-line flags are documented in the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/command-line-arguments.html">rustc book</a>. All <em>stable</em>
flags should be documented there. Unstable flags should be documented in the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/unstable-book/">unstable book</a>.</p>
<p>See the <a href="https://forge.rust-lang.org/compiler/new_option.html">forge guide for new options</a> for details on the <em>procedure</em> for
adding a new command-line argument.</p>
<h2 id="guidelines"><a class="header" href="#guidelines">Guidelines</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Flags should be orthogonal to each other. For example, if we'd have a
json-emitting variant of multiple actions <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code>, an additional
<code>--json</code> flag is better than adding <code>--foo-json</code> and <code>--bar-json</code>.</li>
<li>Avoid flags with the <code>no-</code> prefix. Instead, use the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/e5335592e78354e33d798d20c04bcd677c1df62d/src/librustc_session/options.rs#L307-L313"><code>parse_bool</code></a> function,
such as <code>-C embed-bitcode=no</code>.</li>
<li>Consider the behavior if the flag is passed multiple times. In some
situations, the values should be accumulated (in order!). In other
situations, subsequent flags should override previous flags (for example,
the lint-level flags). And some flags (like <code>-o</code>) should generate an error
if it is too ambiguous what multiple flags would mean.</li>
<li>Always give options a long descriptive name, if only for more understandable
compiler scripts.</li>
<li>The <code>--verbose</code> flag is for adding verbose information to <code>rustc</code>
output. For example, using it with the <code>--version</code>
flag gives information about the hashes of the compiler code.</li>
<li>Experimental flags and options must be guarded behind the <code>-Z unstable-options</code> flag.</li>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="the-rustc-driver-and-interface"><a class="header" href="#the-rustc-driver-and-interface">The Rustc Driver and Interface</a></h1>
<p>The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_driver/"><code>rustc_driver</code></a> is essentially <code>rustc</code>'s <code>main()</code> function. It acts as
the glue for running the various phases of the compiler in the correct order,
using the interface defined in the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_interface/index.html"><code>rustc_interface</code></a> crate.</p>
<p>The <code>rustc_interface</code> crate provides external users with an (unstable) API
for running code at particular times during the compilation process, allowing
third parties to effectively use <code>rustc</code>'s internals as a library for
analyzing a crate or emulating the compiler in-process (e.g. rustdoc).</p>
<p>For those using <code>rustc</code> as a library, the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_interface/interface/fn.run_compiler.html"><code>rustc_interface::run_compiler()</code></a>
function is the main entrypoint to the compiler. It takes a configuration for the compiler
and a closure that takes a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_interface/interface/struct.Compiler.html"><code>Compiler</code></a>. <code>run_compiler</code> creates a <code>Compiler</code> from the
configuration and passes it to the closure. Inside the closure, you can use the <code>Compiler</code>
to drive queries to compile a crate and get the results. This is what the <code>rustc_driver</code> does too.
You can see a minimal example of how to use <code>rustc_interface</code> <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-dev-guide/blob/master/examples/rustc-driver-example.rs">here</a>.</p>
<p>You can see what queries are currently available through the rustdocs for <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_interface/interface/struct.Compiler.html"><code>Compiler</code></a>.
You can see an example of how to use them by looking at the <code>rustc_driver</code> implementation,
specifically the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_driver/fn.run_compiler.html"><code>rustc_driver::run_compiler</code> function</a> (not to be confused with
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_interface/interface/fn.run_compiler.html"><code>rustc_interface::run_compiler</code></a>). The <code>rustc_driver::run_compiler</code> function
takes a bunch of command-line args and some other configurations and
drives the compilation to completion.</p>
<p><code>rustc_driver::run_compiler</code> also takes a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_driver/trait.Callbacks.html"><code>Callbacks</code></a>,
a trait that allows for custom compiler configuration,
as well as allowing some custom code run after different phases of the compilation.</p>

<p>Working directly with source code is very inconvenient and error-prone. Thus,
before we do anything else, we convert raw source code into an AST. It turns
out that doing even this involves a lot of work, including lexing, parsing,
macro expansion, name resolution, conditional compilation, feature-gate
checking, and validation of the AST. In this chapter, we take a look at all
of these steps.</p>
<p>Notably, there isn't always a clean ordering between these tasks. For example,
macro expansion relies on name resolution to resolve the names of macros and
imports. And parsing requires macro expansion, which in turn may require
parsing the output of the macro.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="lexing-and-parsing-1"><a class="header" href="#lexing-and-parsing-1">Lexing and Parsing</a></h1>
<p>As of <!-- date-check --> January 2021, the lexer and parser are undergoing
refactoring to allow extracting them into libraries.</p>
<p>The very first thing the compiler does is take the program (in Unicode
characters) and turn it into something the compiler can work with more
conveniently than strings. This happens in two stages: Lexing and Parsing.</p>
<p>Lexing takes strings and turns them into streams of <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_ast/token/index.html">tokens</a>. For example,
<code>a.b + c</code> would be turned into the tokens <code>a</code>, <code>.</code>, <code>b</code>, <code>+</code>, and <code>c</code>.
The lexer lives in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_lexer/index.html"><code>rustc_lexer</code></a>.</p>
<p>Parsing then takes streams of tokens and turns them into a structured
form which is easier for the compiler to work with, usually called an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree"><em>Abstract
Syntax Tree</em></a> (AST). An AST mirrors the structure of a Rust program in memory,
using a <code>Span</code> to link a particular AST node back to its source text.</p>
<p>The AST is defined in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_ast/index.html"><code>rustc_ast</code></a>, along with some definitions for
tokens and token streams, data structures/traits for mutating ASTs, and shared
definitions for other AST-related parts of the compiler (like the lexer and
macro-expansion).</p>
<p>The parser is defined in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_parse/index.html"><code>rustc_parse</code></a>, along with a
high-level interface to the lexer and some validation routines that run after
macro expansion. In particular, the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_parse/parser/index.html"><code>rustc_parse::parser</code></a> contains
the parser implementation.</p>
<p>The main entrypoint to the parser is via the various <code>parse_*</code> functions and others in the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_parse/index.html">parser crate</a>. They let you do things like turn a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_span/struct.SourceFile.html"><code>SourceFile</code></a>
(e.g. the source in a single file) into a token stream, create a parser from
the token stream, and then execute the parser to get a <code>Crate</code> (the root AST
node).</p>
<p>To minimize the amount of copying that is done,
both <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_parse/lexer/struct.StringReader.html"><code>StringReader</code></a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_parse/parser/struct.Parser.html"><code>Parser</code></a> have lifetimes which bind them to the parent <code>ParseSess</code>.
This contains all the information needed while parsing,
as well as the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_span/source_map/struct.SourceMap.html"><code>SourceMap</code></a> itself.</p>
<p>Note that while parsing, we may encounter macro definitions or invocations. We
set these aside to be expanded (see <a href="./macro-expansion.html">this chapter</a>).
Expansion may itself require parsing the output of the macro, which may reveal
more macros to be expanded, and so on.</p>
<h2 id="more-on-lexical-analysis"><a class="header" href="#more-on-lexical-analysis">More on Lexical Analysis</a></h2>
<p>Code for lexical analysis is split between two crates:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>rustc_lexer</code> crate is responsible for breaking a <code>&amp;str</code> into chunks
constituting tokens. Although it is popular to implement lexers as generated
finite state machines, the lexer in <code>rustc_lexer</code> is hand-written.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_parse/lexer/struct.StringReader.html"><code>StringReader</code></a> integrates <code>rustc_lexer</code> with data structures specific to <code>rustc</code>.
Specifically,
it adds <code>Span</code> information to tokens returned by <code>rustc_lexer</code> and interns identifiers.</p>

<p><code>rustc_ast</code>, <code>rustc_expand</code>, and <code>rustc_builtin_macros</code> are all undergoing
refactoring, so some of the links in this chapter may be broken.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rust has a very powerful macro system. In the previous chapter, we saw how the
parser sets aside macros to be expanded (it temporarily uses <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_expand/placeholders/index.html">placeholders</a>).
This chapter is about the process of expanding those macros iteratively until
we have a complete AST for our crate with no unexpanded macros (or a compile
error).</p>
<p>First, we will discuss the algorithm that expands and integrates macro output
into ASTs. Next, we will take a look at how hygiene data is collected. Finally,
we will look at the specifics of expanding different types of macros.</p>
<p>Many of the algorithms and data structures described below are in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_expand/index.html"><code>rustc_expand</code></a>,
with basic data structures in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_expand/base/index.html"><code>rustc_expand::base</code></a>.</p>
<p>Also of note, <code>cfg</code> and <code>cfg_attr</code> are treated specially from other macros, and are
handled in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_expand/config/index.html"><code>rustc_expand::config</code></a>.</p>
<h2 id="expansion-and-ast-integration"><a class="header" href="#expansion-and-ast-integration">Expansion and AST Integration</a></h2>
<p>First of all, expansion happens at the crate level. Given a raw source code for
a crate, the compiler will produce a massive AST with all macros expanded, all
modules inlined, etc. The primary entry point for this process is the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_expand/expand/struct.MacroExpander.html#method.fully_expand_fragment"><code>MacroExpander::fully_expand_fragment</code></a> method. With few exceptions, we
use this method on the whole crate (see <a href="macro-expansion.html#eager-expansion">&quot;Eager Expansion&quot;</a>
below for more detailed discussion of edge case expansion issues).</p>
<p>At a high level, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_expand/expand/struct.MacroExpander.html#method.fully_expand_fragment"><code>fully_expand_fragment</code></a> works in iterations. We keep a
queue of unresolved macro invocations (that is, macros we haven't found the
definition of yet). We repeatedly try to pick a macro from the queue, resolve
it, expand it, and integrate it back. If we can't make progress in an
iteration, this represents a compile error.  Here is the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/53778#issuecomment-419224049">algorithm</a>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Initialize an <code>queue</code> of unresolved macros.</li>
<li>Repeat until <code>queue</code> is empty (or we make no progress, which is an error):
<ol>
<li><a href="./name-resolution.html">Resolve</a> imports in our partially built crate as
much as possible.</li>
<li>Collect as many macro <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_expand/expand/struct.Invocation.html"><code>Invocation</code>s</a> as possible from our
partially built crate (fn-like, attributes, derives) and add them to the
queue.</li>
<li>Dequeue the first element, and attempt to resolve it.</li>
<li>If it's resolved:
<ol>
<li>Run the macro's expander function that consumes a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_ast/tokenstream/struct.TokenStream.html"><code>TokenStream</code></a> or
AST and produces a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_ast/tokenstream/struct.TokenStream.html"><code>TokenStream</code></a> or <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_expand/expand/enum.AstFragment.html"><code>AstFragment</code></a> (depending on
the macro kind). (A <code>TokenStream</code> is a collection of <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_ast/tokenstream/enum.TokenTree.html"><code>TokenTree</code>s</a>,
each of which are a token (punctuation, identifier, or literal) or a
delimited group (anything inside <code>()</code>/<code>[]</code>/<code>{}</code>)).
<ul>
<li>At this point, we know everything about the macro itself and can
call <code>set_expn_data</code> to fill in its properties in the global data;
that is the hygiene data associated with <code>ExpnId</code>. (See <a href="macro-expansion.html#hygiene-and-hierarchies">the
&quot;Hygiene&quot; section below</a>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Integrate that piece of AST into the big existing partially built
AST. This is essentially where the &quot;token-like mass&quot; becomes a
proper set-in-stone AST with side-tables. It happens as follows:
<ul>
<li>If the macro produces tokens (e.g. a proc macro), we parse into
an AST, which may produce parse errors.</li>
<li>During expansion, we create <code>SyntaxContext</code>s (hierarchy 2). (See
<a href="macro-expansion.html#hygiene-and-hierarchies">the &quot;Hygiene&quot; section below</a>)</li>
<li>These three passes happen one after another on every AST fragment
freshly expanded from a macro:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_ast/node_id/struct.NodeId.html"><code>NodeId</code></a>s are assigned by <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_expand/expand/struct.InvocationCollector.html"><code>InvocationCollector</code></a>. This
also collects new macro calls from this new AST piece and
adds them to the queue.</li>
<li><a href="hir.html#identifiers-in-the-hir">&quot;Def paths&quot;</a> are created and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_hir/def_id/struct.DefId.html"><code>DefId</code></a>s are
assigned to them by <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_resolve/def_collector/struct.DefCollector.html"><code>DefCollector</code></a>.</li>
<li>Names are put into modules (from the resolver's point of
view) by <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_resolve/build_reduced_graph/struct.BuildReducedGraphVisitor.html"><code>BuildReducedGraphVisitor</code></a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After expanding a single macro and integrating its output, continue
to the next iteration of <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_expand/expand/struct.MacroExpander.html#method.fully_expand_fragment"><code>fully_expand_fragment</code></a>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>If it's not resolved:
<ol>
<li>Put the macro back in the queue</li>
<li>Continue to next iteration...</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="error-recovery"><a class="header" href="#error-recovery">Error Recovery</a></h3>
<p>If we make no progress in an iteration, then we have reached a compilation
error (e.g. an undefined macro). We attempt to recover from failures
(unresolved macros or imports) for the sake of diagnostics. This allows
compilation to continue past the first error, so that we can report more errors
at a time. Recovery can't cause compilation to succeed. We know that it will
fail at this point. The recovery happens by expanding unresolved macros into
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_ast/ast/enum.ExprKind.html#variant.Err"><code>ExprKind::Err</code></a>.</p>
<h3 id="name-resolution"><a class="header" href="#name-resolution">Name Resolution</a></h3>
<p>Notice that name resolution is involved here: we need to resolve imports and
macro names in the above algorithm. This is done in
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_resolve/macros/index.html"><code>rustc_resolve::macros</code></a>, which resolves macro paths, validates
those resolutions, and reports various errors (e.g. &quot;not found&quot; or &quot;found, but
it's unstable&quot; or &quot;expected x, found y&quot;). However, we don't try to resolve
other names yet. This happens later, as we will see in the <a href="./name-resolution.html">next
chapter</a>.</p>
<h3 id="eager-expansion"><a class="header" href="#eager-expansion">Eager Expansion</a></h3>
<p><em>Eager expansion</em> means that we expand the arguments of a macro invocation
before the macro invocation itself. This is implemented only for a few special
built-in macros that expect literals; expanding arguments first for some of
these macro results in a smoother user experience.  As an example, consider the
following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">macro bar($i: ident) { $i }
macro foo($i: ident) { $i }

foo!(bar!(baz));
</code></pre>
<p>A lazy expansion would expand <code>foo!</code> first. An eager expansion would expand
<code>bar!</code> first.</p>
<p>Eager expansion is not a generally available feature of Rust.  Implementing
eager expansion more generally would be challenging, but we implement it for a
few special built-in macros for the sake of user experience.  The built-in
macros are implemented in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_builtin_macros/index.html"><code>rustc_builtin_macros</code></a>, along with some other early
code generation facilities like injection of standard library imports or
generation of test harness. There are some additional helpers for building
their AST fragments in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_expand/build/index.html"><code>rustc_expand::build</code></a>. Eager expansion generally
performs a subset of the things that lazy (normal) expansion does. It is done by
invoking <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_expand/expand/struct.MacroExpander.html#method.fully_expand_fragment"><code>fully_expand_fragment</code></a> on only part of a crate (as opposed to
the whole crate, like we normally do).</p>
<h3 id="other-data-structures"><a class="header" href="#other-data-structures">Other Data Structures</a></h3>
<p>Here are some other notable data structures involved in expansion and integration:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_expand/base/trait.ResolverExpand.html"><code>ResolverExpand</code></a> - a trait used to break crate dependencies. This allows the
resolver services to be used in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_ast/index.html"><code>rustc_ast</code></a>, despite <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_resolve/index.html"><code>rustc_resolve</code></a> and
pretty much everything else depending on <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_ast/index.html"><code>rustc_ast</code></a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_expand/base/struct.ExtCtxt.html"><code>ExtCtxt</code></a>/<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_expand/base/struct.ExpansionData.html"><code>ExpansionData</code></a> - various intermediate data kept and used by expansion
infrastructure in the process of its work</li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_expand/base/enum.Annotatable.html"><code>Annotatable</code></a> - a piece of AST that can be an attribute target, almost same
thing as AstFragment except for types and patterns that can be produced by
macros but cannot be annotated with attributes</li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_expand/base/trait.MacResult.html"><code>MacResult</code></a> - a &quot;polymorphic&quot; AST fragment, something that can turn into a
different <code>AstFragment</code> depending on its <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_expand/expand/enum.AstFragmentKind.html"><code>AstFragmentKind</code></a> - item,
or expression, or pattern etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hygiene-and-hierarchies"><a class="header" href="#hygiene-and-hierarchies">Hygiene and Hierarchies</a></h2>
<p>If you have ever used C/C++ preprocessor macros, you know that there are some
annoying and hard-to-debug gotchas! For example, consider the following C code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#define DEFINE_FOO struct Bar {int x;}; struct Foo {Bar bar;};

// Then, somewhere else
struct Bar {
    ...
};

DEFINE_FOO
</code></pre>
<p>Most people avoid writing C like this – and for good reason: it doesn't
compile. The <code>struct Bar</code> defined by the macro clashes names with the <code>struct Bar</code> defined in the code. Consider also the following example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">#define DO_FOO(x) {\
    int y = 0;\
    foo(x, y);\
    }

// Then elsewhere
int y = 22;
DO_FOO(y);
</code></pre>
<p>Do you see the problem? We wanted to generate a call <code>foo(22, 0)</code>, but instead
we got <code>foo(0, 0)</code> because the macro defined its own <code>y</code>!</p>
<p>These are both examples of <em>macro hygiene</em> issues. <em>Hygiene</em> relates to how to
handle names defined <em>within a macro</em>. In particular, a hygienic macro system
prevents errors due to names introduced within a macro. Rust macros are hygienic
in that they do not allow one to write the sorts of bugs above.</p>
<p>At a high level, hygiene within the Rust compiler is accomplished by keeping
track of the context where a name is introduced and used. We can then
disambiguate names based on that context. Future iterations of the macro system
will allow greater control to the macro author to use that context. For example,
a macro author may want to introduce a new name to the context where the macro
was called. Alternately, the macro author may be defining a variable for use
only within the macro (i.e. it should not be visible outside the macro).</p>
<p>The context is attached to AST nodes. All AST nodes generated by macros have
context attached. Additionally, there may be other nodes that have context
attached, such as some desugared syntax (non-macro-expanded nodes are
considered to just have the &quot;root&quot; context, as described below).
Throughout the compiler, we use <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_span/struct.Span.html"><code>rustc_span::Span</code>s</a> to refer to code locations.
This struct also has hygiene information attached to it, as we will see later.</p>
<p>Because macros invocations and definitions can be nested, the syntax context of
a node must be a hierarchy. For example, if we expand a macro and there is
another macro invocation or definition in the generated output, then the syntax
context should reflect the nesting.</p>
<p>However, it turns out that there are actually a few types of context we may
want to track for different purposes. Thus, there are not just one but <em>three</em>
expansion hierarchies that together comprise the hygiene information for a
crate.</p>
<p>All of these hierarchies need some sort of &quot;macro ID&quot; to identify individual
elements in the chain of expansions. This ID is <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_span/hygiene/struct.ExpnId.html"><code>ExpnId</code></a>.  All macros receive
an integer ID, assigned continuously starting from 0 as we discover new macro
calls.  All hierarchies start at <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_span/hygiene/struct.ExpnId.html#method.root"><code>ExpnId::root()</code></a>, which is its own
parent.</p>
<p><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_span/hygiene/index.html"><code>rustc_span::hygiene</code></a> contains all of the hygiene-related algorithms
(with the exception of some hacks in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_resolve/struct.Resolver.html#method.resolve_crate_root"><code>Resolver::resolve_crate_root</code></a>)
and structures related to hygiene and expansion that are kept in global data.</p>
<p>The actual hierarchies are stored in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_span/hygiene/struct.HygieneData.html"><code>HygieneData</code></a>. This is a global
piece of data containing hygiene and expansion info that can be accessed from
any <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_span/symbol/struct.Ident.html"><code>Ident</code></a> without any context.</p>
<h3 id="the-expansion-order-hierarchy"><a class="header" href="#the-expansion-order-hierarchy">The Expansion Order Hierarchy</a></h3>
<p>The first hierarchy tracks the order of expansions, i.e., when a macro
invocation is in the output of another macro.</p>
<p>Here, the children in the hierarchy will be the &quot;innermost&quot; tokens.  The
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_span/hygiene/struct.ExpnData.html"><code>ExpnData</code></a> struct itself contains a subset of properties from both macro
definition and macro call available through global data.
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_span/hygiene/struct.ExpnData.html#structfield.parent"><code>ExpnData::parent</code></a> tracks the child -&gt; parent link in this hierarchy.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">macro_rules! foo { () =&gt; { println!(); } }

fn main() { foo!(); }
</code></pre>
<p>In this code, the AST nodes that are finally generated would have hierarchy:</p>

</code></pre>
<h3 id="the-macro-definition-hierarchy"><a class="header" href="#the-macro-definition-hierarchy">The Macro Definition Hierarchy</a></h3>
<p>The second hierarchy tracks the order of macro definitions, i.e., when we are
expanding one macro another macro definition is revealed in its output.  This
one is a bit tricky and more complex than the other two hierarchies.</p>
<p><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_span/hygiene/struct.SyntaxContext.html"><code>SyntaxContext</code></a> represents a whole chain in this hierarchy via an ID.
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_span/hygiene/struct.SyntaxContextData.html"><code>SyntaxContextData</code></a> contains data associated with the given
<code>SyntaxContext</code>; mostly it is a cache for results of filtering that chain in
different ways.  <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_span/hygiene/struct.SyntaxContextData.html#structfield.parent"><code>SyntaxContextData::parent</code></a> is the child -&gt; parent
link here, and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_span/hygiene/struct.SyntaxContextData.html#structfield.outer_expn"><code>SyntaxContextData::outer_expns</code></a> are individual
elements in the chain.  The &quot;chaining operator&quot; is
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_span/hygiene/struct.SyntaxContext.html#method.apply_mark"><code>SyntaxContext::apply_mark</code></a> in compiler code.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_span/struct.Span.html"><code>Span</code></a>, mentioned above, is actually just a compact representation of
a code location and <code>SyntaxContext</code>. Likewise, an <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_span/symbol/struct.Ident.html"><code>Ident</code></a> is just an interned
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_span/symbol/struct.Symbol.html"><code>Symbol</code></a> + <code>Span</code> (i.e. an interned string + hygiene data).</p>
<p>For built-in macros, we use the context:
<code>SyntaxContext::empty().apply_mark(expn_id)</code>, and such macros are considered to
be defined at the hierarchy root. We do the same for proc-macros because we
haven't implemented cross-crate hygiene yet.</p>
<p>If the token had context <code>X</code> before being produced by a macro then after being
produced by the macro it has context <code>X -&gt; macro_id</code>. Here are some examples:</p>
<p>Example 0:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">macro m() { ident }

m!();
</code></pre>
<p>Here <code>ident</code> originally has context <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_span/hygiene/struct.SyntaxContext.html#method.root"><code>SyntaxContext::root()</code></a>. <code>ident</code> has
context <code>ROOT -&gt; id(m)</code> after it's produced by <code>m</code>.</p>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">macro m() { macro n() { ident } }

m!();
n!();
</code></pre>
<p>In this example the <code>ident</code> has context <code>ROOT</code> originally, then <code>ROOT -&gt; id(m)</code>
after the first expansion, then <code>ROOT -&gt; id(m) -&gt; id(n)</code>.</p>
<p>Example 2:</p>
<p>Note that these chains are not entirely determined by their last element, in
other words <code>ExpnId</code> is not isomorphic to <code>SyntaxContext</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">macro m($i: ident) { macro n() { ($i, bar) } }

m!(foo);
</code></pre>
<p>After all expansions, <code>foo</code> has context <code>ROOT -&gt; id(n)</code> and <code>bar</code> has context
<code>ROOT -&gt; id(m) -&gt; id(n)</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, one last thing to mention is that currently, this hierarchy is subject
to the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/51762#issuecomment-401400732">&quot;context transplantation hack&quot;</a>. Basically, the more modern (and
experimental) <code>macro</code> macros have stronger hygiene than the older MBE system,
but this can result in weird interactions between the two. The hack is intended
to make things &quot;just work&quot; for now.</p>
<h3 id="the-call-site-hierarchy"><a class="header" href="#the-call-site-hierarchy">The Call-site Hierarchy</a></h3>
<p>The third and final hierarchy tracks the location of macro invocations.</p>

<p>Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">macro bar($i: ident) { $i }
macro foo($i: ident) { $i }

foo!(bar!(baz));
</code></pre>
<p>For the <code>baz</code> AST node in the final output, the first hierarchy is <code>ROOT -&gt; id(foo) -&gt; id(bar) -&gt; baz</code>, while the third hierarchy is <code>ROOT -&gt; baz</code>.</p>

<h2 id="producing-macro-output"><a class="header" href="#producing-macro-output">Producing Macro Output</a></h2>
<p>Above, we saw how the output of a macro is integrated into the AST for a crate,
and we also saw how the hygiene data for a crate is generated. But how do we
actually produce the output of a macro? It depends on the type of macro.</p>
<p>There are two types of macros in Rust:
<code>macro_rules!</code> macros (a.k.a. &quot;Macros By Example&quot; (MBE)) and procedural macros
(or &quot;proc macros&quot;; including custom derives). During the parsing phase, the normal
Rust parser will set aside the contents of macros and their invocations. Later,
macros are expanded using these portions of the code.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_expand/base/struct.SyntaxExtension.html"><code>SyntaxExtension</code></a> - a lowered macro representation, contains its expander

<h2 id="macros-by-example"><a class="header" href="#macros-by-example">Macros By Example</a></h2>
<p>MBEs have their own parser distinct from the normal Rust parser. When macros
are expanded, we may invoke the MBE parser to parse and expand a macro.  The
MBE parser, in turn, may call the normal Rust parser when it needs to bind a
metavariable (e.g.  <code>$my_expr</code>) while parsing the contents of a macro
invocation. The code for macro expansion is in
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/compiler/rustc_expand/src/mbe"><code>compiler/rustc_expand/src/mbe/</code></a>.</p>
<h3 id="example"><a class="header" href="#example">Example</a></h3>
<p>It's helpful to have an example to refer to. For the remainder of this chapter,
whenever we refer to the &quot;example <em>definition</em>&quot;, we mean the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">macro_rules! printer {
    (print $mvar:ident) =&gt; {
        println!(&quot;{}&quot;, $mvar);
    };
    (print twice $mvar:ident) =&gt; {
        println!(&quot;{}&quot;, $mvar);
        println!(&quot;{}&quot;, $mvar);
    };
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>$mvar</code> is called a <em>metavariable</em>. Unlike normal variables, rather than
binding to a value in a computation, a metavariable binds <em>at compile time</em> to
a tree of <em>tokens</em>.  A <em>token</em> is a single &quot;unit&quot; of the grammar, such as an
identifier (e.g. <code>foo</code>) or punctuation (e.g. <code>=&gt;</code>). There are also other
special tokens, such as <code>EOF</code>, which indicates that there are no more tokens.
Token trees resulting from paired parentheses-like characters (<code>(</code>...<code>)</code>,
<code>[</code>...<code>]</code>, and <code>{</code>...<code>}</code>) – they include the open and close and all the tokens
in between (we do require that parentheses-like characters be balanced). Having
macro expansion operate on token streams rather than the raw bytes of a source
file abstracts away a lot of complexity. The macro expander (and much of the
rest of the compiler) doesn't really care that much about the exact line and
column of some syntactic construct in the code; it cares about what constructs
are used in the code. Using tokens allows us to care about <em>what</em> without
worrying about <em>where</em>. For more information about tokens, see the
<a href="./the-parser.html">Parsing</a> chapter of this book.</p>
<p>Whenever we refer to the &quot;example <em>invocation</em>&quot;, we mean the following snippet:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">printer!(print foo); // Assume `foo` is a variable defined somewhere else...
</code></pre>
<p>The process of expanding the macro invocation into the syntax tree
<code>println!(&quot;{}&quot;, foo)</code> and then expanding that into a call to <code>Display::fmt</code> is
called <em>macro expansion</em>, and it is the topic of this chapter.</p>
<h3 id="the-mbe-parser"><a class="header" href="#the-mbe-parser">The MBE parser</a></h3>
<p>There are two parts to MBE expansion: parsing the definition and parsing the
invocations. Interestingly, both are done by the macro parser.</p>
<p>Basically, the MBE parser is like an NFA-based regex parser. It uses an
algorithm similar in spirit to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earley_parser">Earley parsing
algorithm</a>. The macro parser is
defined in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_expand/mbe/macro_parser"><code>compiler/rustc_expand/src/mbe/macro_parser.rs</code></a>.</p>
<p>The interface of the macro parser is as follows (this is slightly simplified):</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn parse_tt(
    &amp;mut self,
    parser: &amp;mut Cow&lt;'_, Parser&lt;'_&gt;&gt;,
    matcher: &amp;[MatcherLoc]
) -&gt; ParseResult
</code></pre>
<p>We use these items in macro parser:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>parser</code> is a reference to the state of a normal Rust parser, including the
token stream and parsing session. The token stream is what we are about to
ask the MBE parser to parse. We will consume the raw stream of tokens and
output a binding of metavariables to corresponding token trees. The parsing
session can be used to report parser errors.</li>
<li><code>matcher</code> is a sequence of <code>MatcherLoc</code>s that we want to match
the token stream against. They're converted from token trees before matching.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the analogy of a regex parser, the token stream is the input and we are matching it
against the pattern <code>matcher</code>. Using our examples, the token stream could be the stream of
tokens containing the inside of the example invocation <code>print foo</code>, while <code>matcher</code>
might be the sequence of token (trees) <code>print $mvar:ident</code>.</p>
<p>The output of the parser is a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_expand/mbe/macro_parser/enum.ParseResult.html"><code>ParseResult</code></a>, which indicates which of
three cases has occurred:</p>
<ul>
<li>Success: the token stream matches the given <code>matcher</code>, and we have produced a binding
from metavariables to the corresponding token trees.</li>
<li>Failure: the token stream does not match <code>matcher</code>. This results in an error message such as
&quot;No rule expected token <em>blah</em>&quot;.</li>
<li>Error: some fatal error has occurred <em>in the parser</em>. For example, this
happens if there is more than one pattern match, since that indicates
the macro is ambiguous.</li>
</ul>
<p>The full interface is defined <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_expand/mbe/macro_parser/struct.TtParser.html#method.parse_tt">here</a>.</p>
<p>The macro parser does pretty much exactly the same as a normal regex parser with
one exception: in order to parse different types of metavariables, such as
<code>ident</code>, <code>block</code>, <code>expr</code>, etc., the macro parser must sometimes call back to the
normal Rust parser.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, both definitions and invocations of macros are parsed using
the macro parser. This is extremely non-intuitive and self-referential. The code
to parse macro <em>definitions</em> is in
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_expand/mbe/macro_rules"><code>compiler/rustc_expand/src/mbe/macro_rules.rs</code></a>. It defines the pattern for
matching for a macro definition as <code>$( $lhs:tt =&gt; $rhs:tt );+</code>. In other words,
a <code>macro_rules</code> definition should have in its body at least one occurrence of a
token tree followed by <code>=&gt;</code> followed by another token tree. When the compiler
comes to a <code>macro_rules</code> definition, it uses this pattern to match the two token
trees per rule in the definition of the macro <em>using the macro parser itself</em>.
In our example definition, the metavariable <code>$lhs</code> would match the patterns of
both arms: <code>(print $mvar:ident)</code> and <code>(print twice $mvar:ident)</code>.  And <code>$rhs</code>
would match the bodies of both arms: <code>{ println!(&quot;{}&quot;, $mvar); }</code> and <code>{ println!(&quot;{}&quot;, $mvar); println!(&quot;{}&quot;, $mvar); }</code>. The parser would keep this
knowledge around for when it needs to expand a macro invocation.</p>
<p>When the compiler comes to a macro invocation, it parses that invocation using
the same NFA-based macro parser that is described above. However, the matcher
used is the first token tree (<code>$lhs</code>) extracted from the arms of the macro
<em>definition</em>. Using our example, we would try to match the token stream <code>print foo</code> from the invocation against the matchers <code>print $mvar:ident</code> and <code>print twice $mvar:ident</code> that we previously extracted from the definition.  The
algorithm is exactly the same, but when the macro parser comes to a place in the
current matcher where it needs to match a <em>non-terminal</em> (e.g. <code>$mvar:ident</code>),
it calls back to the normal Rust parser to get the contents of that
non-terminal. In this case, the Rust parser would look for an <code>ident</code> token,
which it finds (<code>foo</code>) and returns to the macro parser. Then, the macro parser
proceeds in parsing as normal. Also, note that exactly one of the matchers from
the various arms should match the invocation; if there is more than one match,
the parse is ambiguous, while if there are no matches at all, there is a syntax
error.</p>

<h3 id="macros-and-macros-20"><a class="header" href="#macros-and-macros-20"><code>macro</code>s and Macros 2.0</a></h3>
<p>There is an old and mostly undocumented effort to improve the MBE system, give
it more hygiene-related features, better scoping and visibility rules, etc. There
hasn't been a lot of work on this recently, unfortunately. Internally, <code>macro</code>
macros use the same machinery as today's MBEs; they just have additional
syntactic sugar and are allowed to be in namespaces.</p>
<h2 id="procedural-macros"><a class="header" href="#procedural-macros">Procedural Macros</a></h2>
<p>Procedural macros are also expanded during parsing, as mentioned above.
However, they use a rather different mechanism. Rather than having a parser in
the compiler, procedural macros are implemented as custom, third-party crates.
The compiler will compile the proc macro crate and specially annotated
functions in them (i.e. the proc macro itself), passing them a stream of tokens.</p>
<p>The proc macro can then transform the token stream and output a new token
stream, which is synthesized into the AST.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that the token stream type used by proc macros is <em>stable</em>,
so <code>rustc</code> does not use it internally (since our internal data structures are
unstable). The compiler's token stream is
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_ast/tokenstream/struct.TokenStream.html"><code>rustc_ast::tokenstream::TokenStream</code></a>, as previously. This is
converted into the stable <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/proc_macro/struct.TokenStream.html"><code>proc_macro::TokenStream</code></a> and back in
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_expand/proc_macro/index.html"><code>rustc_expand::proc_macro</code></a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_expand/proc_macro_server/index.html"><code>rustc_expand::proc_macro_server</code></a>.
Because the Rust ABI is unstable, we use the C ABI for this conversion.</p>

</ul>
<p>In the previous chapters, we saw how the AST is built with all macros expanded.
We saw how doing that requires doing some name resolution to resolve imports
and macro names. In this chapter, we show how this is actually done and more.</p>
<p>In fact, we don't do full name resolution during macro expansion -- we only
resolve imports and macros at that time. This is required to know what to even
expand. Later, after we have the whole AST, we do full name resolution to
resolve all names in the crate. This happens in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_resolve/late/index.html"><code>rustc_resolve::late</code></a>.
Unlike during macro expansion, in this late expansion, we only need to try to
resolve a name once, since no new names can be added. If we fail to resolve a
name now, then it is a compiler error.</p>
<p>Name resolution can be complex. There are a few different namespaces (e.g.
macros, values, types, lifetimes), and names may be valid at different (nested)
scopes. Also, different types of names can fail to be resolved differently, and
failures can happen differently at different scopes. For example, for a module
scope, failure means no unexpanded macros and no unresolved glob imports in
that module. On the other hand, in a function body, failure requires that a
name be absent from the block we are in, all outer scopes, and the global
scope.</p>
<h2 id="basics"><a class="header" href="#basics">Basics</a></h2>
<p>In our programs we can refer to variables, types, functions, etc, by giving them
a name. These names are not always unique. For example, take this valid Rust
program:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>type x = u32;
let x: x = 1;
let y: x = 2;
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>How do we know on line 3 whether <code>x</code> is a type (u32) or a value (1)? These
conflicts are resolved during name resolution. In this specific case, name
resolution defines that type names and variable names live in separate
namespaces and therefore can co-exist.</p>
<p>The name resolution in Rust is a two-phase process. In the first phase, which runs
during macro expansion, we build a tree of modules and resolve imports. Macro
expansion and name resolution communicate with each other via the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_ast_lowering/trait.ResolverAstLoweringExt.html"><code>ResolverAstLoweringExt</code></a> trait.</p>
<p>The input to the second phase is the syntax tree, produced by parsing input
files and expanding macros. This phase produces links from all the names in the
source to relevant places where the name was introduced. It also generates
helpful error messages, like typo suggestions, traits to import or lints about
unused items.</p>
<p>A successful run of the second phase (<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_resolve/struct.Resolver.html#method.resolve_crate"><code>Resolver::resolve_crate</code></a>) creates kind
of an index the rest of the compilation may use to ask about the present names
(through the <code>hir::lowering::Resolver</code> interface).</p>
<p>The name resolution lives in the <code>rustc_resolve</code> crate, with the meat in
<code>lib.rs</code> and some helpers or symbol-type specific logic in the other modules.</p>
<h2 id="namespaces"><a class="header" href="#namespaces">Namespaces</a></h2>
<p>Different kind of symbols live in different namespaces ‒ e.g. types don't
clash with variables. This usually doesn't happen, because variables start with
lower-case letter while types with upper case one, but this is only a
convention. This is legal Rust code that'll compile (with warnings):</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>type x = u32;
let x: x = 1;
let y: x = 2; // See? x is still a type here.
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>To cope with this, and with slightly different scoping rules for these
namespaces, the resolver keeps them separated and builds separate structures for
them.</p>
<p>In other words, when the code talks about namespaces, it doesn't mean the module
hierarchy, it's types vs. values vs. macros.</p>
<h2 id="scopes-and-ribs"><a class="header" href="#scopes-and-ribs">Scopes and ribs</a></h2>
<p>A name is visible only in certain area in the source code. This forms a
hierarchical structure, but not necessarily a simple one ‒ if one scope is
part of another, it doesn't mean the name visible in the outer one is also
visible in the inner one, or that it refers to the same thing.</p>
<p>To cope with that, the compiler introduces the concept of Ribs. This is
abstraction of a scope. Every time the set of visible names potentially changes,
a new rib is pushed onto a stack. The places where this can happen includes for
example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The obvious places ‒ curly braces enclosing a block, function boundaries,
modules.</li>
<li>Introducing a let binding ‒ this can shadow another binding with the same
name.</li>
<li>Macro expansion border ‒ to cope with macro hygiene.</li>
</ul>
<p>When searching for a name, the stack of ribs is traversed from the innermost
outwards. This helps to find the closest meaning of the name (the one not
shadowed by anything else). The transition to outer rib may also change the
rules what names are usable ‒ if there are nested functions (not closures),
the inner one can't access parameters and local bindings of the outer one,
even though they should be visible by ordinary scoping rules. An example:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>fn do_something&lt;T: Default&gt;(val: T) { // &lt;- New rib in both types and values (1)
    // `val` is accessible, as is the helper function
    // `T` is accessible
    let helper = || { // New rib on `helper` (2) and another on the block (3)
        // `val` is accessible here
    }; // End of (3)
    // `val` is accessible, `helper` variable shadows `helper` function
    fn helper() { // &lt;- New rib in both types and values (4)
        // `val` is not accessible here, (4) is not transparent for locals)
        // `T` is not accessible here
    } // End of (4)
    let val = T::default(); // New rib (5)
    // `val` is the variable, not the parameter here
} // End of (5), (2) and (1)
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Because the rules for different namespaces are a bit different, each namespace
has its own independent rib stack that is constructed in parallel to the others.
In addition, there's also a rib stack for local labels (e.g. names of loops or
blocks), which isn't a full namespace in its own right.</p>
<h2 id="overall-strategy"><a class="header" href="#overall-strategy">Overall strategy</a></h2>
<p>To perform the name resolution of the whole crate, the syntax tree is traversed
top-down and every encountered name is resolved. This works for most kinds of
names, because at the point of use of a name it is already introduced in the Rib
hierarchy.</p>
<p>There are some exceptions to this. Items are bit tricky, because they can be
used even before encountered ‒ therefore every block needs to be first scanned
for items to fill in its Rib.</p>
<p>Other, even more problematic ones, are imports which need recursive fixed-point
resolution and macros, that need to be resolved and expanded before the rest of
the code can be processed.</p>
<p>Therefore, the resolution is performed in multiple stages.</p>
<h2 id="speculative-crate-loading"><a class="header" href="#speculative-crate-loading">Speculative crate loading</a></h2>
<p>To give useful errors, rustc suggests importing paths into scope if they're
not found. How does it do this? It looks through every module of every crate
and looks for possible matches. This even includes crates that haven't yet
been loaded!</p>
<p>Loading crates for import suggestions that haven't yet been loaded is called
<em>speculative crate loading</em>, because any errors it encounters shouldn't be
reported: resolve decided to load them, not the user. The function that does
this is <code>lookup_import_candidates</code> and lives in
<code>rustc_resolve/src/diagnostics.rs</code>.</p>
<p>To tell the difference between speculative loads and loads initiated by the
user, resolve passes around a <code>record_used</code> parameter, which is <code>false</code> when
the load is speculative.</p>

</ul>
<p>Today, Rust programmers rely on a built in attribute called <code>#[test]</code>. All
you have to do is mark a function as a test and include some asserts like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">#[test]
fn my_test() {
    assert!(2+2 == 4);
}
</code></pre>
<p>When this program is compiled using <code>rustc --test</code> or <code>cargo test</code>, it will
produce an executable that can run this, and any other test function. This
method of testing allows tests to live alongside code in an organic way. You
can even put tests inside private modules:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">mod my_priv_mod {
    fn my_priv_func() -&gt; bool {}

    #[test]
    fn test_priv_func() {
        assert!(my_priv_func());
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Private items can thus be easily tested without worrying about how to expose
them to any sort of external testing apparatus. This is key to the
ergonomics of testing in Rust. Semantically, however, it's rather odd.
How does any sort of <code>main</code> function invoke these tests if they're not visible?
What exactly is <code>rustc --test</code> doing?</p>
<p><code>#[test]</code> is implemented as a syntactic transformation inside the compiler's
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/compiler/rustc_ast"><code>rustc_ast</code> crate</a>. Essentially, it's a fancy macro, that
rewrites the crate in 3 steps:</p>
<h2 id="step-1-re-exporting"><a class="header" href="#step-1-re-exporting">Step 1: Re-Exporting</a></h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, tests can exist inside private modules, so we need a
way of exposing them to the main function, without breaking any existing
code. To that end, <code>rustc_ast</code> will create local modules called
<code>__test_reexports</code> that recursively reexport tests. This expansion translates
the above example into:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">mod my_priv_mod {
    fn my_priv_func() -&gt; bool {}

    pub fn test_priv_func() {
        assert!(my_priv_func());
    }

    pub mod __test_reexports {
        pub use super::test_priv_func;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now, our test can be accessed as
<code>my_priv_mod::__test_reexports::test_priv_func</code>. For deeper module
structures, <code>__test_reexports</code> will reexport modules that contain tests, so a
test at <code>a::b::my_test</code> becomes
<code>a::__test_reexports::b::__test_reexports::my_test</code>. While this process seems
pretty safe, what happens if there is an existing <code>__test_reexports</code> module?
The answer: nothing.</p>
<p>To explain, we need to understand <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_span/symbol/struct.Ident.html">how the AST represents
identifiers</a>. The name of every function, variable, module, etc. is
not stored as a string, but rather as an opaque <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_span/symbol/struct.Symbol.html">Symbol</a> which is
essentially an ID number for each identifier. The compiler keeps a separate
hashtable that allows us to recover the human-readable name of a Symbol when
necessary (such as when printing a syntax error). When the compiler generates
the <code>__test_reexports</code> module, it generates a new Symbol for the identifier,
so while the compiler-generated <code>__test_reexports</code> may share a name with your
hand-written one, it will not share a Symbol. This technique prevents name
collision during code generation and is the foundation of Rust's macro
hygiene.</p>
<h2 id="step-2-harness-generation"><a class="header" href="#step-2-harness-generation">Step 2: Harness Generation</a></h2>
<p>Now that our tests are accessible from the root of our crate, we need to do
something with them. <code>rustc_ast</code> generates a module like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">#[main]
pub fn main() {
    extern crate test;
    test::test_main_static(&amp;[&amp;path::to::test1, /*...*/]);
}
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>path::to::test1</code> is a constant of type <code>test::TestDescAndFn</code>.</p>
<p>While this transformation is simple, it gives us a lot of insight into how
tests are actually run. The tests are aggregated into an array and passed to
a test runner called <code>test_main_static</code>. We'll come back to exactly what
<code>TestDescAndFn</code> is, but for now, the key takeaway is that there is a crate
called <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/test/index.html"><code>test</code></a> that is part of Rust core, that implements all of the
runtime for testing. <code>test</code>'s interface is unstable, so the only stable way
to interact with it is through the <code>#[test]</code> macro.</p>
<h2 id="step-3-test-object-generation"><a class="header" href="#step-3-test-object-generation">Step 3: Test Object Generation</a></h2>
<p>If you've written tests in Rust before, you may be familiar with some of the
optional attributes available on test functions. For example, a test can be
annotated with <code>#[should_panic]</code> if we expect the test to cause a panic. It
looks something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">#[test]
#[should_panic]
fn foo() {
    panic!(&quot;intentional&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<p>This means our tests are more than just simple functions, they have
configuration information as well. <code>test</code> encodes this configuration data
into a struct called <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/test/struct.TestDesc.html"><code>TestDesc</code></a>. For each test function in a
crate, <code>rustc_ast</code> will parse its attributes and generate a <code>TestDesc</code>
instance. It then combines the <code>TestDesc</code> and test function into the
predictably named <code>TestDescAndFn</code> struct, that <code>test_main_static</code> operates
on. For a given test, the generated <code>TestDescAndFn</code> instance looks like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">self::test::TestDescAndFn{
  desc: self::test::TestDesc{
    name: self::test::StaticTestName(&quot;foo&quot;),
    ignore: false,
    should_panic: self::test::ShouldPanic::Yes,
    allow_fail: false,
  },
  testfn: self::test::StaticTestFn(||
    self::test::assert_test_result(::crate::__test_reexports::foo())),
}
</code></pre>
<p>Once we've constructed an array of these test objects, they're passed to the
test runner via the harness generated in step 2.</p>
<h2 id="inspecting-the-generated-code"><a class="header" href="#inspecting-the-generated-code">Inspecting the generated code</a></h2>
<p>On nightly rust, there's an unstable flag called <code>unpretty</code> that you can use
to print out the module source after macro expansion:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ rustc my_mod.rs -Z unpretty=hir

<h2 id="step-1-invocation-of-the-panic-macro"><a class="header" href="#step-1-invocation-of-the-panic-macro">Step 1: Invocation of the <code>panic!</code> macro.</a></h2>
<p>There are actually two panic macros - one defined in <code>core</code>, and one defined in <code>std</code>.
This is due to the fact that code in <code>core</code> can panic. <code>core</code> is built before <code>std</code>,
but we want panics to use the same machinery at runtime, whether they originate in <code>core</code>
or <code>std</code>.</p>
<h3 id="core-definition-of-panic"><a class="header" href="#core-definition-of-panic">core definition of panic!</a></h3>
<p>The <code>core</code> <code>panic!</code> macro eventually makes the following call (in <code>library/core/src/panicking.rs</code>):</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>// NOTE This function never crosses the FFI boundary; it's a Rust-to-Rust call
extern &quot;Rust&quot; {
    #[lang = &quot;panic_impl&quot;]
    fn panic_impl(pi: &amp;PanicInfo&lt;'_&gt;) -&gt; !;
}

let pi = PanicInfo::internal_constructor(Some(&amp;fmt), location);
unsafe { panic_impl(&amp;pi) }
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Actually resolving this goes through several layers of indirection:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In <code>compiler/rustc_middle/src/middle/weak_lang_items.rs</code>, <code>panic_impl</code> is
declared as 'weak lang item', with the symbol <code>rust_begin_unwind</code>. This is
used in <code>rustc_hir_analysis/src/collect.rs</code> to set the actual symbol name to
<code>rust_begin_unwind</code>.</p>
<p>Note that <code>panic_impl</code> is declared in an <code>extern &quot;Rust&quot;</code> block,
which means that core will attempt to call a foreign symbol called <code>rust_begin_unwind</code>
(to be resolved at link time)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In <code>library/std/src/panicking.rs</code>, we have this definition:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>/// Entry point of panic from the core crate.
#[cfg(not(test))]
#[panic_handler]
#[unwind(allowed)]
pub fn begin_panic_handler(info: &amp;PanicInfo&lt;'_&gt;) -&gt; ! {
    ...
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The special <code>panic_handler</code> attribute is resolved via <code>compiler/rustc_middle/src/middle/lang_items</code>.
The <code>extract</code> function converts the <code>panic_handler</code> attribute to a <code>panic_impl</code> lang item.</p>
<p>Now, we have a matching <code>panic_handler</code> lang item in the <code>std</code>. This function goes
through the same process as the <code>extern { fn panic_impl }</code> definition in <code>core</code>, ending
up with a symbol name of <code>rust_begin_unwind</code>. At link time, the symbol reference in <code>core</code>
will be resolved to the definition of <code>std</code> (the function called <code>begin_panic_handler</code> in the
Rust source).</p>
<p>Thus, control flow will pass from core to std at runtime. This allows panics from <code>core</code>
to go through the same infrastructure that other panics use (panic hooks, unwinding, etc)</p>
<h3 id="std-implementation-of-panic"><a class="header" href="#std-implementation-of-panic">std implementation of panic!</a></h3>
<p>This is where the actual panic-related logic begins. In <code>library/std/src/panicking.rs</code>,
control passes to <code>rust_panic_with_hook</code>. This method is responsible
for invoking the global panic hook, and checking for double panics. Finally,
we call <code>__rust_start_panic</code>, which is provided by the panic runtime.</p>
<p>The call to <code>__rust_start_panic</code> is very weird - it is passed a <code>*mut &amp;mut dyn BoxMeUp</code>,
converted to an <code>usize</code>. Let's break this type down:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><code>BoxMeUp</code> is an internal trait. It is implemented for <code>PanicPayload</code>
(a wrapper around the user-supplied payload type), and has a method
<code>fn box_me_up(&amp;mut self) -&gt; *mut (dyn Any + Send)</code>.
This method takes the user-provided payload (<code>T: Any + Send</code>),
boxes it, and converts the box to a raw pointer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When we call <code>__rust_start_panic</code>, we have an <code>&amp;mut dyn BoxMeUp</code>.
However, this is a fat pointer (twice the size of a <code>usize</code>).
To pass this to the panic runtime across an FFI boundary, we take a mutable
reference <em>to this mutable reference</em> (<code>&amp;mut &amp;mut dyn BoxMeUp</code>), and convert it to a raw pointer
(<code>*mut &amp;mut dyn BoxMeUp</code>). The outer raw pointer is a thin pointer, since it points to a <code>Sized</code>
type (a mutable reference). Therefore, we can convert this thin pointer into a <code>usize</code>, which
is suitable for passing across an FFI boundary.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, we call <code>__rust_start_panic</code> with this <code>usize</code>. We have now entered the panic runtime.</p>
<h2 id="step-2-the-panic-runtime"><a class="header" href="#step-2-the-panic-runtime">Step 2: The panic runtime</a></h2>
<p>Rust provides two panic runtimes: <code>panic_abort</code> and <code>panic_unwind</code>. The user chooses
between them at build time via their <code>Cargo.toml</code></p>
<p><code>panic_abort</code> is extremely simple: its implementation of <code>__rust_start_panic</code> just aborts,
as you would expect.</p>
<p><code>panic_unwind</code> is the more interesting case.</p>
<p>In its implementation of <code>__rust_start_panic</code>, we take the <code>usize</code>, convert
it back to a <code>*mut &amp;mut dyn BoxMeUp</code>, dereference it, and call <code>box_me_up</code>
on the <code>&amp;mut dyn BoxMeUp</code>. At this point, we have a raw pointer to the payload
itself (a <code>*mut (dyn Send + Any)</code>): that is, a raw pointer to the actual value
provided by the user who called <code>panic!</code>.</p>
<p>At this point, the platform-independent code ends. We now call into
platform-specific unwinding logic (e.g <code>unwind</code>). This code is
responsible for unwinding the stack, running any 'landing pads' associated
with each frame (currently, running destructors), and transferring control
to the <code>catch_unwind</code> frame.</p>
<p>Note that all panics either abort the process or get caught by some call to <code>catch_unwind</code>:
in <code>library/std/src/rt.rs</code>, the call to the user-provided
<code>main</code> function is wrapped in <code>catch_unwind</code>.</p>

<p><em>AST validation</em> is a separate AST pass that visits each
item in the tree and performs simple checks. This pass
doesn't perform any complex analysis, type checking or
name resolution.</p>
<p>Before performing any validation, the compiler first expands
the macros. Then this pass performs validations to check
that each AST item is in the correct state. And when this pass
is done, the compiler runs the crate resolution pass.</p>
<h2 id="validations"><a class="header" href="#validations">Validations</a></h2>
<p>Validations are defined in <code>AstValidator</code> type, which 
itself is located in <code>rustc_ast_passes</code> crate. This
type implements various simple checks which emit errors
when certain language rules are broken.</p>
<p>In addition, <code>AstValidator</code> implements <code>Visitor</code> trait
that defines how to visit AST items (which can be functions,
traits, enums, etc).</p>
<p>For each item, visitor performs specific checks. For
example, when visiting a function declaration,
<code>AstValidator</code> checks that the function has:</p>
<ul>
<li>no more than <code>u16::MAX</code> parameters;</li>
<li>c-variadic functions are declared with at least one named argument;</li>
<li>c-variadic argument goes the last in the declaration;</li>

<p>The compiler has certain pluggable operations; that is, functionality that isn't hard-coded into
the language, but is implemented in libraries, with a special marker to tell the compiler it
exists. The marker is the attribute <code>#[lang = &quot;...&quot;]</code>, and there are various different values of
<code>...</code>, i.e. various different 'lang items'.</p>
<p>Many such lang items can be implemented only in one sensible way, such as <code>add</code> (<code>trait core::ops::Add</code>) or <code>future_trait</code> (<code>trait core::future::Future</code>). Others can be overridden to
achieve some specific goals; for example, you can control your binary's entrypoint.</p>
<p>Features provided by lang items include:</p>
<ul>
<li>overloadable operators via traits: the traits corresponding to the
<code>==</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, dereference (<code>*</code>), <code>+</code>, etc. operators are all
marked with lang items; those specific four are <code>eq</code>, <code>ord</code>,
<code>deref</code>, and <code>add</code> respectively.</li>
<li>panicking and stack unwinding; the <code>eh_personality</code>, <code>panic</code> and
<code>panic_bounds_checks</code> lang items.</li>
<li>the traits in <code>std::marker</code> used to indicate properties of types used by the compiler;
lang items <code>send</code>, <code>sync</code> and <code>copy</code>.</li>
<li>the special marker types used for variance indicators found in
<code>core::marker</code>; lang item <code>phantom_data</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lang items are loaded lazily by the compiler; e.g. if one never uses <code>Box</code>
then there is no need to define functions for <code>exchange_malloc</code> and
<code>box_free</code>. <code>rustc</code> will emit an error when an item is needed but not found
in the current crate or any that it depends on.</p>
<p>Most lang items are defined by the <code>core</code> library, but if you're trying to build an
executable with <code>#![no_std]</code>, you'll still need to define a few lang items that are
usually provided by <code>std</code>.</p>
<h2 id="retrieving-a-language-item"><a class="header" href="#retrieving-a-language-item">Retrieving a language item</a></h2>
<p>You can retrieve lang items by calling <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/struct.TyCtxt.html#method.lang_items"><code>tcx.lang_items()</code></a>.</p>
<p>Here's a small example of retrieving the <code>trait Sized {}</code> language item:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {

}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Note that <code>sized_trait()</code> returns an <code>Option</code>, not the <code>DefId</code> itself.
That's because language items are defined in the standard library, so if someone compiles with
<code>#![no_core]</code> (or for some lang items, <code>#![no_std]</code>), the lang item may not be present.
You can either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Give a hard error if the lang item is necessary to continue (don't panic, since this can happen in
user code).</li>
<li>Proceed with limited functionality, by just omitting whatever you were going to do with the

<li><a href="hir.html#hir-bodies">HIR Bodies</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The HIR – &quot;High-Level Intermediate Representation&quot; – is the primary IR used
in most of rustc. It is a compiler-friendly representation of the abstract
syntax tree (AST) that is generated after parsing, macro expansion, and name
resolution (see <a href="./lowering.html">Lowering</a> for how the HIR is created).
Many parts of HIR resemble Rust surface syntax quite closely, with
the exception that some of Rust's expression forms have been desugared away.
For example, <code>for</code> loops are converted into a <code>loop</code> and do not appear in
the HIR. This makes HIR more amenable to analysis than a normal AST.</p>
<p>This chapter covers the main concepts of the HIR.</p>
<p>You can view the HIR representation of your code by passing the
<code>-Z unpretty=hir-tree</code> flag to rustc:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cargo rustc -- -Z unpretty=hir-tree
</code></pre>
<h2 id="out-of-band-storage-and-the-crate-type"><a class="header" href="#out-of-band-storage-and-the-crate-type">Out-of-band storage and the <code>Crate</code> type</a></h2>
<p>The top-level data-structure in the HIR is the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_hir/struct.Crate.html"><code>Crate</code></a>, which stores
the contents of the crate currently being compiled (we only ever
construct HIR for the current crate). Whereas in the AST the crate
data structure basically just contains the root module, the HIR
<code>Crate</code> structure contains a number of maps and other things that
serve to organize the content of the crate for easier access.</p>
<p>For example, the contents of individual items (e.g. modules,
functions, traits, impls, etc) in the HIR are not immediately
accessible in the parents. So, for example, if there is a module item
<code>foo</code> containing a function <code>bar()</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>mod foo {
    fn bar() { }
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>then in the HIR the representation of module <code>foo</code> (the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_hir/struct.Mod.html"><code>Mod</code></a>
struct) would only have the <strong><code>ItemId</code></strong> <code>I</code> of <code>bar()</code>. To get the
details of the function <code>bar()</code>, we would lookup <code>I</code> in the
<code>items</code> map.</p>
<p>One nice result from this representation is that one can iterate
over all items in the crate by iterating over the key-value pairs
in these maps (without the need to trawl through the whole HIR).
There are similar maps for things like trait items and impl items,
as well as &quot;bodies&quot; (explained below).</p>
<p>The other reason to set up the representation this way is for better
integration with incremental compilation. This way, if you gain access
to an <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_hir/struct.Item.html"><code>&amp;rustc_hir::Item</code></a> (e.g. for the mod <code>foo</code>), you do not immediately
gain access to the contents of the function <code>bar()</code>. Instead, you only
gain access to the <strong>id</strong> for <code>bar()</code>, and you must invoke some
function to lookup the contents of <code>bar()</code> given its id; this gives
the compiler a chance to observe that you accessed the data for
<code>bar()</code>, and then record the dependency.</p>
<p><a name="hir-id"></a></p>
<h2 id="identifiers-in-the-hir"><a class="header" href="#identifiers-in-the-hir">Identifiers in the HIR</a></h2>
<p>There are a bunch of different identifiers to refer to other nodes or definitions
in the HIR. In short:</p>

<h2 id="the-hir-map"><a class="header" href="#the-hir-map">The HIR Map</a></h2>
<p>Most of the time when you are working with the HIR, you will do so via
the <strong>HIR Map</strong>, accessible in the tcx via <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/struct.TyCtxt.html#method.hir"><code>tcx.hir()</code></a> (and defined in
the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/hir/map/index.html"><code>hir::map</code></a> module). The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/hir/map/struct.Map.html">HIR map</a> contains a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/hir/map/struct.Map.html#methods">number of methods</a> to
convert between IDs of various kinds and to lookup data associated
with a HIR node.</p>
<p>For example, if you have a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_hir/def_id/struct.LocalDefId.html"><code>LocalDefId</code></a>, and you would like to convert it
to a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_hir/hir_id/struct.HirId.html"><code>HirId</code></a>, you can use <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/hir/map/struct.Map.html#method.local_def_id_to_hir_id"><code>tcx.hir().local_def_id_to_hir_id(def_id)</code></a>.
You need a <code>LocalDefId</code>, rather than a <code>DefId</code>, since only local items have HIR nodes.</p>
<p>Similarly, you can use <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/hir/map/struct.Map.html#method.find"><code>tcx.hir().find(n)</code></a> to lookup the node for a
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_hir/hir_id/struct.HirId.html"><code>HirId</code></a>. This returns a <code>Option&lt;Node&lt;'hir&gt;&gt;</code>, where <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_hir/enum.Node.html"><code>Node</code></a> is an enum
defined in the map. By matching on this, you can find out what sort of
node the <code>HirId</code> referred to and also get a pointer to the data
itself. Often, you know what sort of node <code>n</code> is – e.g. if you know
that <code>n</code> must be some HIR expression, you can do
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/hir/map/struct.Map.html#method.expect_expr"><code>tcx.hir().expect_expr(n)</code></a>, which will extract and return the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_hir/struct.Expr.html"><code>&amp;hir::Expr</code></a>, panicking if <code>n</code> is not in fact an expression.</p>
<p>Finally, you can use the HIR map to find the parents of nodes, via
calls like <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/hir/map/struct.Map.html#method.get_parent"><code>tcx.hir().get_parent(n)</code></a>.</p>
<h2 id="hir-bodies"><a class="header" href="#hir-bodies">HIR Bodies</a></h2>
<p>A <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_hir/struct.Body.html"><code>rustc_hir::Body</code></a> represents some kind of executable code, such as the body
of a function/closure or the definition of a constant. Bodies are
associated with an <strong>owner</strong>, which is typically some kind of item
(e.g. an <code>fn()</code> or <code>const</code>), but could also be a closure expression
(e.g. <code>|x, y| x + y</code>). You can use the HIR map to find the body
associated with a given def-id (<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/hir/map/struct.Map.html#method.maybe_body_owned_by"><code>maybe_body_owned_by</code></a>) or to find
the owner of a body (<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/hir/map/struct.Map.html#method.body_owner_def_id"><code>body_owner_def_id</code></a>).</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="lowering"><a class="header" href="#lowering">Lowering</a></h1>
<p>The lowering step converts AST to <a href="hir.html">HIR</a>.
This means many structures are removed if they are irrelevant
for type analysis or similar syntax agnostic analyses. Examples
of such structures include but are not limited to</p>
<ul>
<li>Parenthesis
<ul>
<li>Removed without replacement, the tree structure makes order explicit</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>for</code> loops and <code>while (let)</code> loops
<ul>
<li>Converted to <code>loop</code> + <code>match</code> and some <code>let</code> bindings</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>if let</code>
<ul>
<li>Converted to <code>match</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Universal <code>impl Trait</code>
<ul>
<li>Converted to generic arguments
(but with some flags, to know that the user didn't write them)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Existential <code>impl Trait</code>
<ul>
<li>Converted to a virtual <code>existential type</code> declaration</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Lowering needs to uphold several invariants in order to not trigger the
sanity checks in <code>compiler/rustc_passes/src/hir_id_validator.rs</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li>A <code>HirId</code> must be used if created. So if you use the <code>lower_node_id</code>,
you <em>must</em> use the resulting <code>NodeId</code> or <code>HirId</code> (either is fine, since
any <code>NodeId</code>s in the <code>HIR</code> are checked for existing <code>HirId</code>s)</li>
<li>Lowering a <code>HirId</code> must be done in the scope of the <em>owning</em> item.
This means you need to use <code>with_hir_id_owner</code> if you are creating parts
of an item other than the one being currently lowered. This happens for
example during the lowering of existential <code>impl Trait</code></li>
<li>A <code>NodeId</code> that will be placed into a HIR structure must be lowered,
even if its <code>HirId</code> is unused. Calling
<code>let _ = self.lower_node_id(node_id);</code> is perfectly legitimate.</li>
<li>If you are creating new nodes that didn't exist in the <code>AST</code>, you <em>must</em>
create new ids for them. This is done by calling the <code>next_id</code> method,
which produces both a new <code>NodeId</code> as well as automatically lowering it
for you so you also get the <code>HirId</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you are creating new <code>DefId</code>s, since each <code>DefId</code> needs to have a
corresponding <code>NodeId</code>, it is advisable to add these <code>NodeId</code>s to the
<code>AST</code> so you don't have to generate new ones during lowering. This has
the advantage of creating a way to find the <code>DefId</code> of something via its
<code>NodeId</code>. If lowering needs this <code>DefId</code> in multiple places, you can't
generate a new <code>NodeId</code> in all those places because you'd also get a new
<code>DefId</code> then. With a <code>NodeId</code> from the <code>AST</code> this is not an issue.</p>
<p>Having the <code>NodeId</code> also allows the <code>DefCollector</code> to generate the <code>DefId</code>s
instead of lowering having to do it on the fly. Centralizing the <code>DefId</code>
generation in one place makes it easier to refactor and reason about.</p>

<p>The <code>-Z unpretty=hir-tree</code> flag will dump out the HIR.</p>
<p>If you are trying to correlate <code>NodeId</code>s or <code>DefId</code>s with source code, the
<code>--pretty expanded,identified</code> flag may be useful.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="the-thir"><a class="header" href="#the-thir">The THIR</a></h1>
<p>The THIR (&quot;Typed High-Level Intermediate Representation&quot;), previously called HAIR for
&quot;High-Level Abstract IR&quot;, is another IR used by rustc that is generated after
<a href="./type-checking.html">type checking</a>. It is (as of <!-- date-check --> April 2022) only used for
<a href="./mir/construction.html">MIR construction</a> and <a href="./pat-exhaustive-checking.html">exhaustiveness checking</a>. There is also
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/issues/402">an experimental unsafety checker</a> that operates on the THIR as a replacement for
the current MIR unsafety checker, and can be used instead of the MIR unsafety checker by passing
the <code>-Z thir-unsafeck</code> flag to <code>rustc</code>.</p>
<p>As the name might suggest, the THIR is a lowered version of the <a href="./hir.html">HIR</a> where all
the types have been filled in, which is possible after type checking has completed.
But it has some other interesting features that distinguish it from the HIR:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Like the MIR, the THIR only represents bodies, i.e. &quot;executable code&quot;; this includes
function bodies, but also <code>const</code> initializers, for example. Specifically, all <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_hir/enum.BodyOwnerKind.html">body owners</a> have
THIR created. Consequently, the THIR has no representation for items like <code>struct</code>s or <code>trait</code>s.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each body of THIR is only stored temporarily and is dropped as soon as it's no longer
needed, as opposed to being stored until the end of the compilation process (which
is what is done with the HIR).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Besides making the types of all nodes available, the THIR also has additional
desugaring compared to the HIR. For example, automatic references and dereferences
are made explicit, and method calls and overloaded operators are converted into
plain function calls. Destruction scopes are also made explicit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Statements, expressions, and match arms are stored separately. For example, statements in the
<code>stmts</code> array reference expressions by their index (represented as a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/thir/struct.ExprId.html"><code>ExprId</code></a>) in the <code>exprs</code>
array.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The THIR lives in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_build/thir/index.html"><code>rustc_mir_build::thir</code></a>. To construct a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/thir/struct.Expr.html"><code>thir::Expr</code></a>,
you can use the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/context/struct.TyCtxt.html#method.thir_body"><code>thir_body</code></a> function, passing in the memory arena where the THIR
will be allocated. Dropping this arena will result in the THIR being destroyed,
which is useful to keep peak memory in check. Having a THIR representation of
all bodies of a crate in memory at the same time would be very heavy.</p>
<p>You can get a debug representation of the THIR by passing the <code>-Zunpretty=thir-tree</code> flag
to <code>rustc</code>.</p>
<p>To demonstrate, let's use the following example:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let x = 1 + 2;
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Here is how that gets represented in THIR (as of <!-- date-check --> Aug 2022):</p>

</span><span class="boring">fn main() {

<p>MIR is Rust's <em>Mid-level Intermediate Representation</em>. It is
constructed from <a href="mir/../hir.html">HIR</a>. MIR was introduced in
<a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/1211-mir.html">RFC 1211</a>. It is a radically simplified form of Rust that is used for
certain flow-sensitive safety checks – notably the borrow checker! –
and also for optimization and code generation.</p>
<p>If you'd like a very high-level introduction to MIR, as well as some
of the compiler concepts that it relies on (such as control-flow
graphs and desugaring), you may enjoy the
<a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2016/04/19/MIR.html">rust-lang blog post that introduced MIR</a>.</p>
<h2 id="introduction-to-mir"><a class="header" href="#introduction-to-mir">Introduction to MIR</a></h2>
<p>MIR is defined in the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/index.html"><code>compiler/rustc_middle/src/mir/</code></a> module, but much of the code
that manipulates it is found in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_build/index.html"><code>compiler/rustc_mir_build</code></a>,
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_transform/index.html"><code>compiler/rustc_mir_transform</code></a>, and
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_dataflow/index.html"><code>compiler/rustc_mir_dataflow</code></a>.</p>
<p>Some of the key characteristics of MIR are:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is based on a <a href="mir/../appendix/background.html#cfg">control-flow graph</a>.</li>
<li>It does not have nested expressions.</li>
<li>All types in MIR are fully explicit.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="key-mir-vocabulary"><a class="header" href="#key-mir-vocabulary">Key MIR vocabulary</a></h2>
<p>This section introduces the key concepts of MIR, summarized here:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Basic blocks</strong>: units of the control-flow graph, consisting of:
<ul>
<li><strong>statements:</strong> actions with one successor</li>
<li><strong>terminators:</strong> actions with potentially multiple successors; always at
the end of a block</li>
<li>(if you're not familiar with the term <em>basic block</em>, see the <a href="mir/../appendix/background.html#cfg">background
chapter</a>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Locals:</strong> Memory locations allocated on the stack (conceptually, at
least), such as function arguments, local variables, and
temporaries. These are identified by an index, written with a
leading underscore, like <code>_1</code>. There is also a special &quot;local&quot;
(<code>_0</code>) allocated to store the return value.</li>
<li><strong>Places:</strong> expressions that identify a location in memory, like <code>_1</code> or
<code>_1.f</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Rvalues:</strong> expressions that produce a value. The &quot;R&quot; stands for
the fact that these are the &quot;right-hand side&quot; of an assignment.
<ul>
<li><strong>Operands:</strong> the arguments to an rvalue, which can either be a
constant (like <code>22</code>) or a place (like <code>_1</code>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can get a feeling for how MIR is constructed by translating simple
programs into MIR and reading the pretty printed output. In fact, the
playground makes this easy, since it supplies a MIR button that will
show you the MIR for your program. Try putting this program into play
(or <a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=30074856e62e74e91f06abd19bd72ece&amp;version=stable">clicking on this link</a>), and then clicking the &quot;MIR&quot;
button on the top:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let mut vec = Vec::new();
    vec.push(1);
    vec.push(2);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>You should see something like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-mir">// WARNING: This output format is intended for human consumers only
// and is subject to change without notice. Knock yourself out.
fn main() -&gt; () {
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is the MIR format for the <code>main</code> function.</p>
<p><strong>Variable declarations.</strong> If we drill in a bit, we'll see it begins
with a bunch of variable declarations. They look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-mir">let mut _0: ();                      // return place
let mut _1: std::vec::Vec&lt;i32&gt;;      // in scope 0 at src/main.rs:2:9: 2:16
let mut _2: ();
let mut _3: &amp;mut std::vec::Vec&lt;i32&gt;;
let mut _4: ();
let mut _5: &amp;mut std::vec::Vec&lt;i32&gt;;
</code></pre>
<p>You can see that variables in MIR don't have names, they have indices,
like <code>_0</code> or <code>_1</code>.  We also intermingle the user's variables (e.g.,
<code>_1</code>) with temporary values (e.g., <code>_2</code> or <code>_3</code>). You can tell apart
user-defined variables because they have debuginfo associated to them (see below).</p>
<p><strong>User variable debuginfo.</strong> Below the variable declarations, we find the only
hint that <code>_1</code> represents a user variable:</p>
<pre><code class="language-mir">scope 1 {
    debug vec =&gt; _1;                 // in scope 1 at src/main.rs:2:9: 2:16
}
</code></pre>
<p>Each <code>debug &lt;Name&gt; =&gt; &lt;Place&gt;;</code> annotation describes a named user variable,
and where (i.e. the place) a debugger can find the data of that variable.
Here the mapping is trivial, but optimizations may complicate the place,
or lead to multiple user variables sharing the same place.
Additionally, closure captures are described using the same system, and so
they're complicated even without optimizations, e.g.: <code>debug x =&gt; (*((*_1).0: &amp;T));</code>.</p>
<p>The &quot;scope&quot; blocks (e.g., <code>scope 1 { .. }</code>) describe the lexical structure of
the source program (which names were in scope when), so any part of the program
annotated with <code>// in scope 0</code> would be missing <code>vec</code>, if you were stepping
through the code in a debugger, for example.</p>
<p><strong>Basic blocks.</strong> Reading further, we see our first <strong>basic block</strong> (naturally
it may look slightly different when you view it, and I am ignoring some of the
comments):</p>
<pre><code class="language-mir">bb0: {
    StorageLive(_1);
    _1 = const &lt;std::vec::Vec&lt;T&gt;&gt;::new() -&gt; bb2;
}
</code></pre>
<p>A basic block is defined by a series of <strong>statements</strong> and a final
<strong>terminator</strong>.  In this case, there is one statement:</p>
<pre><code class="language-mir">StorageLive(_1);
</code></pre>
<p>This statement indicates that the variable <code>_1</code> is &quot;live&quot;, meaning
that it may be used later – this will persist until we encounter a
<code>StorageDead(_1)</code> statement, which indicates that the variable <code>_1</code> is
done being used. These &quot;storage statements&quot; are used by LLVM to
allocate stack space.</p>
<p>The <strong>terminator</strong> of the block <code>bb0</code> is the call to <code>Vec::new</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-mir">_1 = const &lt;std::vec::Vec&lt;T&gt;&gt;::new() -&gt; bb2;
</code></pre>
<p>Terminators are different from statements because they can have more
than one successor – that is, control may flow to different
places. Function calls like the call to <code>Vec::new</code> are always
terminators because of the possibility of unwinding, although in the
case of <code>Vec::new</code> we are able to see that indeed unwinding is not
possible, and hence we list only one successor block, <code>bb2</code>.</p>
<p>If we look ahead to <code>bb2</code>, we will see it looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-mir">bb2: {
    StorageLive(_3);
    _3 = &amp;mut _1;
    _2 = const &lt;std::vec::Vec&lt;T&gt;&gt;::push(move _3, const 1i32) -&gt; [return: bb3, unwind: bb4];
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here there are two statements: another <code>StorageLive</code>, introducing the <code>_3</code>
temporary, and then an assignment:</p>
<pre><code class="language-mir">_3 = &amp;mut _1;
</code></pre>
<p>Assignments in general have the form:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">&lt;Place&gt; = &lt;Rvalue&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>A place is an expression like <code>_3</code>, <code>_3.f</code> or <code>*_3</code> – it denotes a
location in memory.  An <strong>Rvalue</strong> is an expression that creates a
value: in this case, the rvalue is a mutable borrow expression, which
looks like <code>&amp;mut &lt;Place&gt;</code>. So we can kind of define a grammar for
rvalues like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">&lt;Rvalue&gt;  = &amp; (mut)? &lt;Place&gt;
          | &lt;Operand&gt; + &lt;Operand&gt;
          | &lt;Operand&gt; - &lt;Operand&gt;
          | ...

&lt;Operand&gt; = Constant
          | copy Place
          | move Place
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see from this grammar, rvalues cannot be nested – they can
only reference places and constants. Moreover, when you use a place,
we indicate whether we are <strong>copying it</strong> (which requires that the
place have a type <code>T</code> where <code>T: Copy</code>) or <strong>moving it</strong> (which works
for a place of any type). So, for example, if we had the expression <code>x = a + b + c</code> in Rust, that would get compiled to two statements and a
temporary:</p>
<pre><code class="language-mir">TMP1 = a + b
x = TMP1 + c
</code></pre>
<p>(<a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=1751196d63b2a71f8208119e59d8a5b6&amp;version=stable">Try it and see</a>, though you may want to do release mode to skip
over the overflow checks.)</p>
<h2 id="mir-data-types"><a class="header" href="#mir-data-types">MIR data types</a></h2>
<p>The MIR data types are defined in the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/index.html"><code>compiler/rustc_middle/src/mir/</code></a>
module.  Each of the key concepts mentioned in the previous section
maps in a fairly straightforward way to a Rust type.</p>
<p>The main MIR data type is <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/struct.Body.html"><code>Body</code></a>. It contains the data for a single
function (along with sub-instances of Mir for &quot;promoted constants&quot;,
but <a href="mir/index.html#promoted">you can read about those below</a>).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Basic blocks</strong>: The basic blocks are stored in the field
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/struct.Body.html#structfield.basic_blocks"><code>Body::basic_blocks</code></a>; this is a vector
of <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/struct.BasicBlockData.html"><code>BasicBlockData</code></a> structures. Nobody ever references a
basic block directly: instead, we pass around <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/struct.BasicBlock.html"><code>BasicBlock</code></a>
values, which are <a href="mir/../appendix/glossary.html#newtype">newtype'd</a> indices into this vector.</li>
<li><strong>Statements</strong> are represented by the type <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/struct.Statement.html"><code>Statement</code></a>.</li>
<li><strong>Terminators</strong> are represented by the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/terminator/struct.Terminator.html"><code>Terminator</code></a>.</li>
<li><strong>Locals</strong> are represented by a <a href="mir/../appendix/glossary.html#newtype">newtype'd</a> index type <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/struct.Local.html"><code>Local</code></a>.
The data for a local variable is found in the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/struct.Body.html#structfield.local_decls"><code>Body::local_decls</code></a> vector). There is also a special constant
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/constant.RETURN_PLACE.html"><code>RETURN_PLACE</code></a> identifying the special &quot;local&quot; representing the return value.</li>
<li><strong>Places</strong> are identified by the enum <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/struct.Place.html"><code>Place</code></a>. There are a few
variants:
<ul>
<li>Local variables like <code>_1</code></li>
<li>Static variables <code>FOO</code></li>
<li><strong>Projections</strong>, which are fields or other things that &quot;project
out&quot; from a base place. These are represented by the type
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/enum.ProjectionElem.html"><code>ProjectionElem</code></a>.  So e.g. the place <code>_1.f</code> is a projection,
with <code>f</code> being the &quot;projection element&quot; and <code>_1</code> being the base
path. <code>*_1</code> is also a projection, with the <code>*</code> being represented
by the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/enum.ProjectionElem.html#variant.Deref"><code>ProjectionElem::Deref</code></a> element.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Rvalues</strong> are represented by the enum <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/enum.Rvalue.html"><code>Rvalue</code></a>.</li>
<li><strong>Operands</strong> are represented by the enum <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/enum.Operand.html"><code>Operand</code></a>.</li>

<p>The lowering of <a href="mir/../hir.html">HIR</a> to <a href="mir/./index.html">MIR</a> occurs for the following (probably incomplete)
list of items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Function and closure bodies</li>
<li>Initializers of <code>static</code> and <code>const</code> items</li>
<li>Initializers of enum discriminants</li>
<li>Glue and shims of any kind
<ul>
<li>Tuple struct initializer functions</li>
<li>Drop code (the <code>Drop::drop</code> function is not called directly)</li>
<li>Drop implementations of types without an explicit <code>Drop</code> implementation</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The lowering is triggered by calling the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_build/build/fn.mir_built.html"><code>mir_built</code></a> query. The MIR builder does
not actually use the HIR but operates on the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_build/thir/index.html">THIR</a> instead, processing THIR
expressions recursively.</p>
<p>The lowering creates local variables for every argument as specified in the signature.
Next, it creates local variables for every binding specified (e.g. <code>(a, b): (i32, String)</code>)
produces 3 bindings, one for the argument, and two for the bindings. Next, it generates
field accesses that read the fields from the argument and writes the value to the binding
variable.</p>
<p>With this initialization out of the way, the lowering triggers a recursive call
to a function that generates the MIR for the body (a <code>Block</code> expression) and
writes the result into the <code>RETURN_PLACE</code>.</p>
<h2 id="unpack-all-the-things"><a class="header" href="#unpack-all-the-things"><code>unpack!</code> all the things</a></h2>
<p>Functions that generate MIR tend to fall into one of two patterns.
First, if the function generates only statements, then it will take a
basic block as argument onto which those statements should be appended.
It can then return a result as normal:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn generate_some_mir(&amp;mut self, block: BasicBlock) -&gt; ResultType {
   ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>But there are other functions that may generate new basic blocks as well.
For example, lowering an expression like <code>if foo { 22 } else { 44 }</code>
requires generating a small &quot;diamond-shaped graph&quot;.
In this case, the functions take a basic block where their code starts
and return a (potentially) new basic block where the code generation ends.
The <code>BlockAnd</code> type is used to represent this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn generate_more_mir(&amp;mut self, block: BasicBlock) -&gt; BlockAnd&lt;ResultType&gt; {
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>When you invoke these functions, it is common to have a local variable <code>block</code>
that is effectively a &quot;cursor&quot;. It represents the point at which we are adding new MIR.
When you invoke <code>generate_more_mir</code>, you want to update this cursor.
You can do this manually, but it's tedious:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let mut block;
let v = match self.generate_more_mir(..) {
    BlockAnd { block: new_block, value: v } =&gt; {
        block = new_block;
        v
    }
};
</code></pre>
<p>For this reason, we offer a macro that lets you write
<code>let v = unpack!(block = self.generate_more_mir(...))</code>.
It simply extracts the new block and overwrites the
variable <code>block</code> that you named in the <code>unpack!</code>.</p>
<h2 id="lowering-expressions-into-the-desired-mir"><a class="header" href="#lowering-expressions-into-the-desired-mir">Lowering expressions into the desired MIR</a></h2>
<p>There are essentially four kinds of representations one might want of an expression:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Place</code> refers to a (or part of a) preexisting memory location (local, static, promoted)</li>
<li><code>Rvalue</code> is something that can be assigned to a <code>Place</code></li>
<li><code>Operand</code> is an argument to e.g. a <code>+</code> operation or a function call</li>
<li>a temporary variable containing a copy of the value</li>
</ul>
<p>The following image depicts a general overview of the interactions between the
representations:</p>
<img src="mir/mir_overview.svg">
<p><a href="mir/mir_detailed.svg">Click here for a more detailed view</a></p>
<p>We start out with lowering the function body to an <code>Rvalue</code> so we can create an
assignment to <code>RETURN_PLACE</code>, This <code>Rvalue</code> lowering will in turn trigger lowering to
<code>Operand</code> for its arguments (if any). <code>Operand</code> lowering either produces a <code>const</code>
operand, or moves/copies out of a <code>Place</code>, thus triggering a <code>Place</code> lowering. An
expression being lowered to a <code>Place</code> can in turn trigger a temporary to be created
if the expression being lowered contains operations. This is where the snake bites its
own tail and we need to trigger an <code>Rvalue</code> lowering for the expression to be written
into the local.</p>
<h2 id="operator-lowering"><a class="header" href="#operator-lowering">Operator lowering</a></h2>
<p>Operators on builtin types are not lowered to function calls (which would end up being
infinite recursion calls, because the trait impls just contain the operation itself
again). Instead there are <code>Rvalue</code>s for binary and unary operators and index operations.
These <code>Rvalue</code>s later get codegened to llvm primitive operations or llvm intrinsics.</p>
<p>Operators on all other types get lowered to a function call to their <code>impl</code> of the
operator's corresponding trait.</p>
<p>Regardless of the lowering kind, the arguments to the operator are lowered to <code>Operand</code>s.
This means all arguments are either constants, or refer to an already existing value
somewhere in a local or static.</p>
<h2 id="method-call-lowering"><a class="header" href="#method-call-lowering">Method call lowering</a></h2>
<p>Method calls are lowered to the same <code>TerminatorKind</code> that function calls are.
In <a href="mir/./index.html">MIR</a> there is no difference between method calls and function calls anymore.</p>
<h2 id="conditions"><a class="header" href="#conditions">Conditions</a></h2>
<p><code>if</code> conditions and <code>match</code> statements for <code>enum</code>s without variants with fields are
lowered to <code>TerminatorKind::SwitchInt</code>. Each possible value (so <code>0</code> and <code>1</code> for <code>if</code>
conditions) has a corresponding <code>BasicBlock</code> to which the code continues.
The argument being branched on is (again) an <code>Operand</code> representing the value of
the if condition.</p>
<h3 id="pattern-matching"><a class="header" href="#pattern-matching">Pattern matching</a></h3>
<p><code>match</code> statements for <code>enum</code>s with variants that have fields are lowered to
<code>TerminatorKind::SwitchInt</code>, too, but the <code>Operand</code> refers to a <code>Place</code> where the
discriminant of the value can be found. This often involves reading the discriminant
to a new temporary variable.</p>
<h2 id="aggregate-construction"><a class="header" href="#aggregate-construction">Aggregate construction</a></h2>
<p>Aggregate values of any kind (e.g. structs or tuples) are built via <code>Rvalue::Aggregate</code>.
All fields are
lowered to <code>Operator</code>s. This is essentially equivalent to one assignment
statement per aggregate field plus an assignment to the discriminant in the
case of <code>enum</code>s.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="mir-visitor"><a class="header" href="#mir-visitor">MIR visitor</a></h1>
<p>The MIR visitor is a convenient tool for traversing the MIR and either
looking for things or making changes to it. The visitor traits are
defined in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/visit/index.html">the <code>rustc_middle::mir::visit</code> module</a> – there are two of
them, generated via a single macro: <code>Visitor</code> (which operates on a
<code>&amp;Mir</code> and gives back shared references) and <code>MutVisitor</code> (which
operates on a <code>&amp;mut Mir</code> and gives back mutable references).</p>
<p>To implement a visitor, you have to create a type that represents
your visitor. Typically, this type wants to &quot;hang on&quot; to whatever
state you will need while processing MIR:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">struct MyVisitor&lt;...&gt; {
    tcx: TyCtxt&lt;'tcx&gt;,
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>and you then implement the <code>Visitor</code> or <code>MutVisitor</code> trait for that type:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">impl&lt;'tcx&gt; MutVisitor&lt;'tcx&gt; for NoLandingPads {
    fn visit_foo(&amp;mut self, ...) {
        ...
        self.super_foo(...);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>As shown above, within the impl, you can override any of the
<code>visit_foo</code> methods (e.g., <code>visit_terminator</code>) in order to write some
code that will execute whenever a <code>foo</code> is found. If you want to
recursively walk the contents of the <code>foo</code>, you then invoke the
<code>super_foo</code> method. (NB. You never want to override <code>super_foo</code>.)</p>
<p>A very simple example of a visitor can be found in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_transform/simplify_try/struct.LocalUseCounter.html"><code>LocalUseCounter</code></a>.
By implementing <code>visit_local</code> method, this visitor counts how many times each local is used.</p>
<h2 id="traversal"><a class="header" href="#traversal">Traversal</a></h2>
<p>In addition the visitor, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/traversal/index.html">the <code>rustc_middle::mir::traversal</code> module</a>
contains useful functions for walking the MIR CFG in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal">different standard orders</a> (e.g. pre-order, reverse
post-order, and so forth).</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="mir-passes"><a class="header" href="#mir-passes">MIR passes</a></h1>
<p>If you would like to get the MIR for a function (or constant, etc),
you can use the <code>optimized_mir(def_id)</code> query. This will give you back
the final, optimized MIR. For foreign def-ids, we simply read the MIR
from the other crate's metadata. But for local def-ids, the query will
construct the MIR and then iteratively optimize it by applying a
series of passes. This section describes how those passes work and how
you can extend them.</p>
<p>To produce the <code>optimized_mir(D)</code> for a given def-id <code>D</code>, the MIR
passes through several suites of optimizations, each represented by a
query. Each suite consists of multiple optimizations and
transformations. These suites represent useful intermediate points
where we want to access the MIR for type checking or other purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>mir_build(D)</code> – not a query, but this constructs the initial MIR</li>
<li><code>mir_const(D)</code> – applies some simple transformations to make MIR ready for
constant evaluation;</li>
<li><code>mir_validated(D)</code> – applies some more transformations, making MIR ready for
borrow checking;</li>
<li><code>optimized_mir(D)</code> – the final state, after all optimizations have been
performed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="implementing-and-registering-a-pass"><a class="header" href="#implementing-and-registering-a-pass">Implementing and registering a pass</a></h3>
<p>A <code>MirPass</code> is some bit of code that processes the MIR, typically –
but not always – transforming it along the way somehow. For example,
it might perform an optimization. The <code>MirPass</code> trait itself is found
in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_transform/">the <code>rustc_mir_transform</code> crate</a>, and it
basically consists of one method, <code>run_pass</code>, that simply gets an
<code>&amp;mut Mir</code> (along with the tcx and some information about where it
came from). The MIR is therefore modified in place (which helps to
keep things efficient).</p>
<p>A basic example of a MIR pass is <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_transform/remove_storage_markers/struct.RemoveStorageMarkers.html"><code>RemoveStorageMarkers</code></a>, which walks
the MIR and removes all storage marks if they won't be emitted during codegen. As you
can see from its source, a MIR pass is defined by first defining a
dummy type, a struct with no fields, something like:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>struct MyPass;
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>for which you then implement the <code>MirPass</code> trait. You can then insert
this pass into the appropriate list of passes found in a query like
<code>optimized_mir</code>, <code>mir_validated</code>, etc. (If this is an optimization, it
should go into the <code>optimized_mir</code> list.)</p>
<p>If you are writing a pass, there's a good chance that you are going to
want to use a <a href="mir/./visitor.html">MIR visitor</a>. MIR visitors are a handy way to walk all
the parts of the MIR, either to search for something or to make small
edits.</p>
<h3 id="stealing"><a class="header" href="#stealing">Stealing</a></h3>
<p>The intermediate queries <code>mir_const()</code> and <code>mir_validated()</code> yield up
a <code>&amp;'tcx Steal&lt;Mir&lt;'tcx&gt;&gt;</code>, allocated using
<code>tcx.alloc_steal_mir()</code>. This indicates that the result may be
<strong>stolen</strong> by the next suite of optimizations – this is an
optimization to avoid cloning the MIR. Attempting to use a stolen
result will cause a panic in the compiler. Therefore, it is important
that you do not read directly from these intermediate queries except as
part of the MIR processing pipeline.</p>
<p>Because of this stealing mechanism, some care must also be taken to
ensure that, before the MIR at a particular phase in the processing
pipeline is stolen, anyone who may want to read from it has already
done so. Concretely, this means that if you have some query <code>foo(D)</code>
that wants to access the result of <code>mir_const(D)</code> or
<code>mir_validated(D)</code>, you need to have the successor pass &quot;force&quot;
<code>foo(D)</code> using <code>ty::queries::foo::force(...)</code>. This will force a query
to execute even though you don't directly require its result.</p>
<p>As an example, consider MIR const qualification. It wants to read the
result produced by the <code>mir_const()</code> suite. However, that result will
be <strong>stolen</strong> by the <code>mir_validated()</code> suite. If nothing was done,
then <code>mir_const_qualif(D)</code> would succeed if it came before
<code>mir_validated(D)</code>, but fail otherwise. Therefore, <code>mir_validated(D)</code>
will <strong>force</strong> <code>mir_const_qualif</code> before it actually steals, thus
ensuring that the reads have already happened (remember that
<a href="mir/../query.html">queries are memoized</a>, so executing a query twice
simply loads from a cache the second time):</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">mir_const(D) --read-by--&gt; mir_const_qualif(D)
     |                       ^
  stolen-by                  |
     |                    (forces)
     v                       |
mir_validated(D) ------------+
</code></pre>
<p>This mechanism is a bit dodgy. There is a discussion of more elegant
alternatives in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/41710">rust-lang/rust#41710</a>.</p>

<p>If you have read the few previous chapters, you now know that <code>rustc</code> uses
many different intermediate representations to perform different kinds of analyses.
However, like in every data structure, you need a way to traverse the structure
and refer to other elements. In this chapter, you will find information on the
different identifiers <code>rustc</code> uses for each intermediate representation.</p>
<h2 id="in-the-ast"><a class="header" href="#in-the-ast">In the AST</a></h2>
<p>A <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_ast/node_id/struct.NodeId.html"><code>NodeId</code></a> is an identifier number that uniquely identifies an AST node within
a crate. Every node in the AST has its own <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_ast/node_id/struct.NodeId.html"><code>NodeId</code></a>, including top-level items
such as structs, but also individual statements and expressions.</p>
<p>However, because they are absolute within a crate, adding or removing a single
node in the AST causes all the subsequent <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_ast/node_id/struct.NodeId.html"><code>NodeId</code></a>s to change. This renders
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_ast/node_id/struct.NodeId.html"><code>NodeId</code></a>s pretty much useless for incremental compilation, where you want as
few things as possible to change.</p>
<p><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_ast/node_id/struct.NodeId.html"><code>NodeId</code></a>s are used in all the <code>rustc</code> bits that operate directly on the AST,
like macro expansion and name resolution.</p>
<h2 id="in-the-hir"><a class="header" href="#in-the-hir">In the HIR</a></h2>
<p>The HIR uses a bunch of different identifiers that coexist and serve different purposes.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_hir/def_id/struct.DefId.html"><code>DefId</code></a>, as the name suggests, identifies a particular definition, or top-level
item, in a given crate. It is composed of two parts: a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_hir/def_id/struct.CrateNum.html"><code>CrateNum</code></a> which identifies
the crate the definition comes from, and a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_hir/def_id/struct.DefIndex.html"><code>DefIndex</code></a> which identifies the definition
within the crate. Unlike <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_hir/hir_id/struct.HirId.html"><code>HirId</code></a>s, there isn't a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_hir/def_id/struct.DefId.html"><code>DefId</code></a> for every expression, which
makes them more stable across compilations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_hir/def_id/struct.LocalDefId.html"><code>LocalDefId</code></a> is basically a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_hir/def_id/struct.DefId.html"><code>DefId</code></a> that is known to come from the current crate.
This allows us to drop the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_hir/def_id/struct.CrateNum.html"><code>CrateNum</code></a> part, and use the type system to ensure that
only local definitions are passed to functions that expect a local definition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_hir/hir_id/struct.HirId.html"><code>HirId</code></a> uniquely identifies a node in the HIR of the current crate. It is composed
of two parts: an <code>owner</code> and a <code>local_id</code> that is unique within the <code>owner</code>. This
combination makes for more stable values which are helpful for incremental compilation.

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="closure-expansion-in-rustc"><a class="header" href="#closure-expansion-in-rustc">Closure Expansion in rustc</a></h1>
<p>This section describes how rustc handles closures. Closures in Rust are
effectively &quot;desugared&quot; into structs that contain the values they use (or
references to the values they use) from their creator's stack frame. rustc has
the job of figuring out which values a closure uses and how, so it can decide
whether to capture a given variable by shared reference, mutable reference, or
by move. rustc also has to figure out which of the closure traits (<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Fn.html"><code>Fn</code></a>,
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.FnMut.html"><code>FnMut</code></a>, or <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.FnOnce.html"><code>FnOnce</code></a>) a closure is capable of
implementing.</p>
<p>Let's start with a few examples:</p>
<h3 id="example-1"><a class="header" href="#example-1">Example 1</a></h3>
<p>To start, let's take a look at how the closure in the following example is desugared:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn closure(f: impl Fn()) {
    f();
}

fn main() {
    let x: i32 = 10;
    closure(|| println!(&quot;Hi {}&quot;, x));  // The closure just reads x.
    println!(&quot;Value of x after return {}&quot;, x);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Let's say the above is the content of a file called <code>immut.rs</code>. If we compile
<code>immut.rs</code> using the following command. The <a href="./mir/passes.html"><code>-Z dump-mir=all</code></a> flag will cause
<code>rustc</code> to generate and dump the <a href="./mir/index.html">MIR</a> to a directory called <code>mir_dump</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">&gt; rustc +stage1 immut.rs -Z dump-mir=all
</code></pre>
<p>After we run this command, we will see a newly generated directory in our
current working directory called <code>mir_dump</code>, which will contain several files.
If we look at file <code>rustc.main.-------.mir_map.0.mir</code>, we will find, among
other things, it also contains this line:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">_4 = &amp;_1;
_3 = [closure@immut.rs:7:13: 7:36] { x: move _4 };
</code></pre>
<p>Note that in the MIR examples in this chapter, <code>_1</code> is <code>x</code>.</p>
<p>Here in first line <code>_4 = &amp;_1;</code>, the <code>mir_dump</code> tells us that <code>x</code> was borrowed
as an immutable reference.  This is what we would hope as our closure just
reads <code>x</code>.</p>
<h3 id="example-2"><a class="header" href="#example-2">Example 2</a></h3>
<p>Here is another example:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn closure(mut f: impl FnMut()) {
    f();
}

fn main() {
    let mut x: i32 = 10;
    closure(|| {
        x += 10;  // The closure mutates the value of x
        println!(&quot;Hi {}&quot;, x)
    });
    println!(&quot;Value of x after return {}&quot;, x);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">_4 = &amp;mut _1;
_3 = [closure@mut.rs:7:13: 10:6] { x: move _4 };
</code></pre>
<p>This time along, in the line <code>_4 = &amp;mut _1;</code>, we see that the borrow is changed to mutable borrow.
Fair enough! The closure increments <code>x</code> by 10.</p>
<h3 id="example-3"><a class="header" href="#example-3">Example 3</a></h3>
<p>One more example:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn closure(f: impl FnOnce()) {
    f();
}

fn main() {
    let x = vec![21];
    closure(|| {
        drop(x);  // Makes x unusable after the fact.
    });
    // println!(&quot;Value of x after return {:?}&quot;, x);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">_6 = [closure@move.rs:7:13: 9:6] { x: move _1 }; // bb16[3]: scope 1 at move.rs:7:13: 9:6
</code></pre>
<p>Here, <code>x</code> is directly moved into the closure and the access to it will not be permitted after the
closure.</p>
<h2 id="inferences-in-the-compiler"><a class="header" href="#inferences-in-the-compiler">Inferences in the compiler</a></h2>
<p>Now let's dive into rustc code and see how all these inferences are done by the compiler.</p>
<p>Let's start with defining a term that we will be using quite a bit in the rest of the discussion -
<em>upvar</em>. An <strong>upvar</strong> is a variable that is local to the function where the closure is defined. So,
in the above examples, <strong>x</strong> will be an upvar to the closure. They are also sometimes referred to as
the <em>free variables</em> meaning they are not bound to the context of the closure.
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_query_impl/queries/struct.upvars_mentioned.html"><code>compiler/rustc_middle/src/ty/query/mod.rs</code></a> defines a query called <em>upvars_mentioned</em>
for this purpose.</p>
<p>Other than lazy invocation, one other thing that distinguishes a closure from a
normal function is that it can use the upvars. It borrows these upvars from its surrounding
context; therefore the compiler has to determine the upvar's borrow type. The compiler starts with
assigning an immutable borrow type and lowers the restriction (that is, changes it from
<strong>immutable</strong> to <strong>mutable</strong> to <strong>move</strong>) as needed, based on the usage. In the Example 1 above, the
closure only uses the variable for printing but does not modify it in any way and therefore, in the
<code>mir_dump</code>, we find the borrow type for the upvar <code>x</code> to be immutable.  In example 2, however, the
closure modifies <code>x</code> and increments it by some value.  Because of this mutation, the compiler, which
started off assigning <code>x</code> as an immutable reference type, has to adjust it as a mutable reference.
Likewise in the third example, the closure drops the vector and therefore this requires the variable
<code>x</code> to be moved into the closure. Depending on the borrow kind, the closure has to implement the
appropriate trait: <code>Fn</code> trait for immutable borrow, <code>FnMut</code> for mutable borrow,
and <code>FnOnce</code> for move semantics.</p>
<p>Most of the code related to the closure is in the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_hir_typeck/upvar/index.html"><code>compiler/rustc_hir_typeck/src/upvar.rs</code></a> file and the data structures are
declared in the file <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/index.html"><code>compiler/rustc_middle/src/ty/mod.rs</code></a>.</p>
<p>Before we go any further, let's discuss how we can examine the flow of control through the rustc
codebase. For closures specifically, set the <code>RUSTC_LOG</code> env variable as below and collect the
output in a file:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">&gt; RUSTC_LOG=rustc_hir_typeck::upvar rustc +stage1 -Z dump-mir=all \
    &lt;.rs file to compile&gt; 2&gt; &lt;file where the output will be dumped&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This uses the stage1 compiler and enables <code>debug!</code> logging for the
<code>rustc_hir_typeck::upvar</code> module.</p>
<p>The other option is to step through the code using lldb or gdb.</p>
<ol>
<li><code>rust-lldb build/x86_64-apple-darwin/stage1/bin/rustc test.rs</code></li>
<li>In lldb:
<ol>
<li><code>b upvar.rs:134</code>  // Setting the breakpoint on a certain line in the upvar.rs file`</li>
<li><code>r</code>  // Run the program until it hits the breakpoint</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's start with <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_hir_typeck/upvar/index.html"><code>upvar.rs</code></a>. This file has something called
the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_hir_typeck/expr_use_visitor/struct.ExprUseVisitor.html"><code>euv::ExprUseVisitor</code></a> which walks the source of the closure and
invokes a callback for each upvar that is borrowed, mutated, or moved.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let mut x = vec![21];
    let _cl = || {
        let y = x[0];  // 1.
        x[0] += 1;  // 2.
    };
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>In the above example, our visitor will be called twice, for the lines marked 1 and 2, once for a
shared borrow and another one for a mutable borrow. It will also tell us what was borrowed.</p>
<p>The callbacks are defined by implementing the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_hir_typeck/expr_use_visitor/trait.Delegate.html"><code>Delegate</code></a> trait. The
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_hir_typeck/upvar/struct.InferBorrowKind.html"><code>InferBorrowKind</code></a> type implements <code>Delegate</code> and keeps a map that
records for each upvar which mode of capture was required. The modes of capture
can be <code>ByValue</code> (moved) or <code>ByRef</code> (borrowed). For <code>ByRef</code> borrows, the possible
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/enum.BorrowKind.html"><code>BorrowKind</code></a>s are <code>ImmBorrow</code>, <code>UniqueImmBorrow</code>, <code>MutBorrow</code> as defined in the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/index.html"><code>compiler/rustc_middle/src/ty/mod.rs</code></a>.</p>
<p><code>Delegate</code> defines a few different methods (the different callbacks):
<strong>consume</strong> for <em>move</em> of a variable, <strong>borrow</strong> for a <em>borrow</em> of some kind
(shared or mutable), and <strong>mutate</strong> when we see an <em>assignment</em> of something.</p>
<p>All of these callbacks have a common argument <em>cmt</em> which stands for Category,
Mutability and Type and is defined in
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_hir_typeck/mem_categorization/index.html"><code>compiler/rustc_middle/src/middle/mem_categorization.rs</code></a>. Borrowing from the code
comments, &quot;<code>cmt</code> is a complete categorization of a value indicating where it
originated and how it is located, as well as the mutability of the memory in
which the value is stored&quot;. Based on the callback (consume, borrow etc.), we
will call the relevant <code>adjust_upvar_borrow_kind_for_&lt;something&gt;</code> and pass the
<code>cmt</code> along. Once the borrow type is adjusted, we store it in the table, which
basically says what borrows were made for each closure.</p>

    .borrow_mut()
    .upvar_capture_map
    .extend(delegate.adjust_upvar_captures);

through all of the compiler layers down to LLVM codegen. Throughout the various stages, an
<code>InlineAsm</code> generally consists of 3 components:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The template string, which is stored as an array of <code>InlineAsmTemplatePiece</code>. Each piece
represents either a literal or a placeholder for an operand (just like format strings).</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]

    String(String),
    Placeholder { operand_idx: usize, modifier: Option&lt;char&gt;, span: Span },
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>The list of operands to the <code>asm!</code> (<code>in</code>, <code>[late]out</code>, <code>in[late]out</code>, <code>sym</code>, <code>const</code>). These are
represented differently at each stage of lowering, but follow a common pattern:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>in</code>, <code>out</code> and <code>inout</code> all have an associated register class (<code>reg</code>) or explicit register
(<code>&quot;eax&quot;</code>).</li>
<li><code>inout</code> has 2 forms: one with a single expression that is both read from and written to, and
one with two separate expressions for the input and output parts.</li>
<li><code>out</code> and <code>inout</code> have a <code>late</code> flag (<code>lateout</code> / <code>inlateout</code>) to indicate that the register
allocator is allowed to reuse an input register for this output.</li>
<li><code>out</code> and the split variant of <code>inout</code> allow <code>_</code> to be specified for an output, which means
that the output is discarded. This is used to allocate scratch registers for assembly code.</li>
<li><code>const</code> refers to an anonymous constants and generally works like an inline const.</li>
<li><code>sym</code> is a bit special since it only accepts a path expression, which must point to a <code>static</code>
or a <code>fn</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The options set at the end of the <code>asm!</code> macro. The only ones that are of particular interest to
rustc are <code>NORETURN</code> which makes <code>asm!</code> return <code>!</code> instead of <code>()</code>, and <code>RAW</code> which disables format
string parsing. The remaining options are mostly passed through to LLVM with little processing.</p>

<p>The <code>asm!</code> macro is implemented in <code>rustc_builtin_macros</code> and outputs an <code>InlineAsm</code> AST node. The
template string is parsed using <code>fmt_macros</code>, positional and named operands are resolved to
explicit operand indices. Since target information is not available to macro invocations,
validation of the registers and register classes is deferred to AST lowering.</p>

<p>AST lowering is where <code>InlineAsmRegOrRegClass</code> is converted from <code>Symbol</code>s to an actual register or
register class. If any modifiers are specified for a template string placeholder, these are
validated against the set allowed for that operand type. Finally, explicit registers for inputs and
outputs are checked for conflicts (same register used for different operands).</p>
<h2 id="type-checking"><a class="header" href="#type-checking">Type checking</a></h2>
<p>Each register class has a whitelist of types that it may be used with. After the types of all
operands have been determined, the <code>intrinsicck</code> pass will check that these types are in the
whitelist. It also checks that split <code>inout</code> operands have compatible types and that <code>const</code>
operands are integers or floats. Suggestions are emitted where needed if a template modifier should
be used for an operand based on the type that was passed into it.</p>
<h2 id="thir"><a class="header" href="#thir">THIR</a></h2>

<p>The operands are lowered to LLVM operands and constraint codes as follow:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>out</code> and the output part of <code>inout</code> operands are added first, as required by LLVM. Late output
operands have a <code>=</code> prefix added to their constraint code, non-late output operands have a <code>=&amp;</code>
prefix added to their constraint code.</li>
<li><code>in</code> operands are added normally.</li>
<li><code>inout</code> operands are tied to the matching output operand.</li>
<li><code>sym</code> operands are passed as function pointers or pointers, using the <code>&quot;s&quot;</code> constraint.</li>
<li><code>const</code> operands are formatted to a string and directly inserted in the template string.</li>
</ul>
<p>The template string is converted to LLVM form:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>$</code> characters are escaped as <code>$$</code>.</li>
<li><code>const</code> operands are converted to strings and inserted directly.</li>
<li>Placeholders are formatted as <code>${X:M}</code> where <code>X</code> is the operand index and <code>M</code> is the modifier
character. Modifiers are converted from the Rust form to the LLVM form.</li>
</ul>
<p>The various options are converted to clobber constraints or LLVM attributes, refer to the
<a href="https://github.com/Amanieu/rfcs/blob/inline-asm/text/0000-inline-asm.md#mapping-to-llvm-ir">RFC</a>
for more details.</p>
<p>Note that LLVM is sometimes rather picky about what types it accepts for certain constraint codes
so we sometimes need to insert conversions to/from a supported type. See the target-specific
ISelLowering.cpp files in LLVM for details of what types are supported for each register class.</p>
<h2 id="adding-support-for-new-architectures"><a class="header" href="#adding-support-for-new-architectures">Adding support for new architectures</a></h2>
<p>Adding inline assembly support to an architecture is mostly a matter of defining the registers and
register classes for that architecture. All the definitions for register classes are located in
<code>compiler/rustc_target/asm/</code>.</p>
<p>Additionally you will need to implement lowering of these register classes to LLVM constraint codes
in <code>compiler/rustc_codegen_llvm/asm.rs</code>.</p>
<p>When adding a new architecture, make sure to cross-reference with the LLVM source code:</p>
<ul>
<li>LLVM has restrictions on which types can be used with a particular constraint code. Refer to the
<code>getRegForInlineAsmConstraint</code> function in <code>lib/Target/${ARCH}/${ARCH}ISelLowering.cpp</code>.</li>
<li>LLVM reserves certain registers for its internal use, which causes them to not be saved/restored
properly around inline assembly blocks. These registers are listed in the <code>getReservedRegs</code>
function in <code>lib/Target/${ARCH}/${ARCH}RegisterInfo.cpp</code>. Any &quot;conditionally&quot; reserved register
such as the frame/base pointer must always be treated as reserved for Rust purposes because we
can't know ahead of time whether a function will require a frame/base pointer.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="tests-2"><a class="header" href="#tests-2">Tests</a></h2>
<p>Various tests for inline assembly are available:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>tests/assembly/asm</code></li>
<li><code>tests/ui/asm</code></li>
<li><code>tests/codegen/asm-*</code></li>

<p>Every architecture supported by inline assembly must have exhaustive tests in

<p>This part discusses the many analyses that the compiler uses to check various
properties of the code and to inform later stages. Typically, this is what people
mean when they talk about &quot;Rust's type system&quot;. This includes the
representation, inference, and checking of types, the trait system, and the
borrow checker. These analyses do not happen as one big pass or set of
contiguous passes. Rather, they are spread out throughout various parts of the
compilation process and use different intermediate representations. For example,
type checking happens on the HIR, while borrow checking happens on the MIR.
Nonetheless, for the sake of presentation, we will discuss all of these
analyses in this part of the guide.</p>

<p>The <code>ty</code> module defines how the Rust compiler represents types internally. It also defines the
<em>typing context</em> (<code>tcx</code> or <code>TyCtxt</code>), which is the central data structure in the compiler.</p>
<h2 id="tyty-1"><a class="header" href="#tyty-1"><code>ty::Ty</code></a></h2>
<p>When we talk about how rustc represents types,  we usually refer to a type called <code>Ty</code> . There are
quite a few modules and types for <code>Ty</code> in the compiler (<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/index.html">Ty documentation</a>).</p>
<p>The specific <code>Ty</code> we are referring to is <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/struct.Ty.html"><code>rustc_middle::ty::Ty</code></a> (and not
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_hir/struct.Ty.html"><code>rustc_hir::Ty</code></a>). The distinction is important, so we will discuss it first before going
into the details of <code>ty::Ty</code>.</p>
<h2 id="rustc_hirty-vs-tyty"><a class="header" href="#rustc_hirty-vs-tyty"><code>rustc_hir::Ty</code> vs <code>ty::Ty</code></a></h2>
<p>The HIR in rustc can be thought of as the high-level intermediate representation. It is more or less
the AST (see <a href="hir.html">this chapter</a>) as it represents the
syntax that the user wrote, and is obtained after parsing and some <em>desugaring</em>. It has a
representation of types, but in reality it reflects more of what the user wrote, that is, what they
wrote so as to represent that type.</p>
<p>In contrast, <code>ty::Ty</code> represents the semantics of a type, that is, the <em>meaning</em> of what the user
wrote. For example, <code>rustc_hir::Ty</code> would record the fact that a user used the name <code>u32</code> twice
in their program, but the <code>ty::Ty</code> would record the fact that both usages refer to the same type.</p>
<p><strong>Example: <code>fn foo(x: u32) → u32 { x }</code></strong></p>
<p>In this function, we see that <code>u32</code> appears twice. We know
that that is the same type,
i.e. the function takes an argument and returns an argument of the same type,
but from the point of view of the HIR,
there would be two distinct type instances because these
are occurring in two different places in the program.
That is, they have two different <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_span/struct.Span.html"><code>Span</code>s</a> (locations).</p>
<p><strong>Example: <code>fn foo(x: &amp;u32) -&gt; &amp;u32</code></strong></p>
<p>In addition, HIR might have information left out. This type
<code>&amp;u32</code> is incomplete, since in the full Rust type there is actually a lifetime, but we didn’t need
to write those lifetimes. There are also some elision rules that insert information. The result may
look like  <code>fn foo&lt;'a&gt;(x: &amp;'a u32) -&gt; &amp;'a u32</code>.</p>
<p>In the HIR level, these things are not spelled out and you can say the picture is rather incomplete.
However, at the <code>ty::Ty</code> level, these details are added and it is complete. Moreover, we will have
exactly one <code>ty::Ty</code> for a given type, like <code>u32</code>, and that <code>ty::Ty</code> is used for all <code>u32</code>s in the
whole program, not a specific usage, unlike <code>rustc_hir::Ty</code>.</p>
<p>Here is a summary:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_hir/struct.Ty.html"><code>rustc_hir::Ty</code></a></th><th><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/struct.Ty.html"><code>ty::Ty</code></a></th></tr></thead><tbody>

<tr><td>Each <code>rustc_hir::Ty</code> has its own spans corresponding to the appropriate place in the program.</td><td>Doesn’t correspond to a single place in the user’s program.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>rustc_hir::Ty</code> has generics and lifetimes; however, some of those lifetimes are special markers like <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_hir/enum.LifetimeName.html#variant.Implicit"><code>LifetimeName::Implicit</code></a>.</td><td><code>ty::Ty</code> has the full type, including generics and lifetimes, even if the user left them out</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>fn foo(x: u32) → u32 { }</code> - Two <code>rustc_hir::Ty</code> representing each usage of <code>u32</code>, each has its own <code>Span</code>s, and <code>rustc_hir::Ty</code> doesn’t tell us that both are the same type</td><td><code>fn foo(x: u32) → u32 { }</code> - One <code>ty::Ty</code> for all instances of <code>u32</code> throughout the program, and <code>ty::Ty</code> tells us that both usages of <code>u32</code> mean the same type.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>fn foo(x: &amp;u32) -&gt; &amp;u32)</code> - Two <code>rustc_hir::Ty</code> again. Lifetimes for the references show up in the <code>rustc_hir::Ty</code>s using a special marker, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_hir/enum.LifetimeName.html#variant.Implicit"><code>LifetimeName::Implicit</code></a>.</td><td><code>fn foo(x: &amp;u32) -&gt; &amp;u32)</code>- A single <code>ty::Ty</code>. The <code>ty::Ty</code> has the hidden lifetime param.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p><strong>Order</strong></p>
<p>HIR is built directly from the AST, so it happens before any <code>ty::Ty</code> is produced. After
HIR is built, some basic type inference and type checking is done. During the type inference, we
figure out what the <code>ty::Ty</code> of everything is and we also check if the type of something is
ambiguous. The <code>ty::Ty</code> is then used for type checking while making sure everything has the
expected type. The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_hir_analysis/astconv/index.html"><code>astconv</code> module</a> is where the code responsible for converting a
<code>rustc_hir::Ty</code> into a <code>ty::Ty</code> is located. This occurs during the type-checking phase,
but also in other parts of the compiler that want to ask questions like &quot;what argument types does
this function expect?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>How semantics drive the two instances of <code>Ty</code></strong></p>
<p>You can think of HIR as the perspective
of the type information that assumes the least. We assume two things are distinct until they are
proven to be the same thing. In other words, we know less about them, so we should assume less about
them.</p>
<p>They are syntactically two strings: <code>&quot;u32&quot;</code> at line N column 20 and <code>&quot;u32&quot;</code> at line N column 35. We
don’t know that they are the same yet. So, in the HIR we treat them as if they are different. Later,
we determine that they semantically are the same type and that’s the <code>ty::Ty</code> we use.</p>
<p>Consider another example: <code>fn foo&lt;T&gt;(x: T) -&gt; u32</code>. Suppose that someone invokes <code>foo::&lt;u32&gt;(0)</code>.
This means that <code>T</code> and <code>u32</code> (in this invocation) actually turns out to be the same type, so we
would eventually end up with the same <code>ty::Ty</code> in the end, but we have distinct <code>rustc_hir::Ty</code>.
(This is a bit over-simplified, though, since during type checking, we would check the function
generically and would still have a <code>T</code> distinct from <code>u32</code>. Later, when doing code generation,
we would always be handling &quot;monomorphized&quot; (fully substituted) versions of each function,
and hence we would know what <code>T</code> represents (and specifically that it is <code>u32</code>).)</p>
<p>Here is one more example:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>mod a {
    type X = u32;
    pub fn foo(x: X) -&gt; u32 { 22 }
}
mod b {
    type X = i32;
    pub fn foo(x: X) -&gt; i32 { x }
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Here the type <code>X</code> will vary depending on context, clearly. If you look at the <code>rustc_hir::Ty</code>,
you will get back that <code>X</code> is an alias in both cases (though it will be mapped via name resolution
to distinct aliases). But if you look at the <code>ty::Ty</code> signature, it will be either <code>fn(u32) -&gt; u32</code>
or <code>fn(i32) -&gt; i32</code> (with type aliases fully expanded).</p>

<p><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/struct.Ty.html"><code>rustc_middle::ty::Ty</code></a> is actually a wrapper around
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/enum.TyKind.html"><code>Interned&lt;WithCachedTypeInfo&lt;TyKind&gt;&gt;</code></a>.
You can ignore <code>Interned</code> in general; you will basically never access it explicitly.
We always hide them within <code>Ty</code> and skip over it via <code>Deref</code> impls or methods.
<code>TyKind</code> is a big enum
with variants to represent many different Rust types
(e.g. primitives, references, abstract data types, generics, lifetimes, etc).
<code>WithCachedTypeInfo</code> has a few cached values like <code>flags</code> and <code>outer_exclusive_binder</code>. They
are convenient hacks for efficiency and summarize information about the type that we may want to
know, but they don’t come into the picture as much here. Finally, <a href="./memory.html"><code>Interned</code></a> allows
the <code>ty::Ty</code> to be a thin pointer-like
type. This allows us to do cheap comparisons for equality, along with the other
benefits of interning.</p>
<h2 id="allocating-and-working-with-types"><a class="header" href="#allocating-and-working-with-types">Allocating and working with types</a></h2>
<p>To allocate a new type, you can use the various <code>mk_</code> methods defined on the <code>tcx</code>. These have names
that correspond mostly to the various kinds of types. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let array_ty = tcx.mk_array(elem_ty, len * 2);
</code></pre>
<p>These methods all return a <code>Ty&lt;'tcx&gt;</code> – note that the lifetime you get back is the lifetime of the
arena that this <code>tcx</code> has access to. Types are always canonicalized and interned (so we never
allocate exactly the same type twice).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>N.B.
Because types are interned, it is possible to compare them for equality efficiently using <code>==</code>
– however, this is almost never what you want to do unless you happen to be hashing and looking
for duplicates. This is because often in Rust there are multiple ways to represent the same type,
particularly once inference is involved. If you are going to be testing for type equality, you
probably need to start looking into the inference code to do it right.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can also find various common types in the <code>tcx</code> itself by accessing its fields:
<code>tcx.types.bool</code>, <code>tcx.types.char</code>, etc. (See <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/context/struct.CommonTypes.html"><code>CommonTypes</code></a> for more.)</p>
<h2 id="tytykind-variants"><a class="header" href="#tytykind-variants"><code>ty::TyKind</code> Variants</a></h2>
<p>Note: <code>TyKind</code> is <strong>NOT</strong> the functional programming concept of <em>Kind</em>.</p>
<p>Whenever working with a <code>Ty</code> in the compiler, it is common to match on the kind of type:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn foo(x: Ty&lt;'tcx&gt;) {
  match x.kind {
    ...
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>kind</code> field is of type <code>TyKind&lt;'tcx&gt;</code>, which is an enum defining all of the different kinds of
types in the compiler.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>N.B. inspecting the <code>kind</code> field on types during type inference can be risky, as there may be
inference variables and other things to consider, or sometimes types are not yet known and will
become known later.</p>

<p>There are a lot of related types, and we’ll cover them in time (e.g regions/lifetimes,
“substitutions”, etc).</p>
<p>There are many variants on the <code>TyKind</code> enum, which you can see by looking at its

<p>Although there is no hard and fast rule, the <code>ty</code> module tends to be used like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">use ty::{self, Ty, TyCtxt};
</code></pre>
<p>In particular, since they are so common, the <code>Ty</code> and <code>TyCtxt</code> types are imported directly. Other
types are often referenced with an explicit <code>ty::</code> prefix (e.g. <code>ty::TraitRef&lt;'tcx&gt;</code>). But some
modules choose to import a larger or smaller set of names explicitly.</p>
<h2 id="adts-representation"><a class="header" href="#adts-representation">ADTs Representation</a></h2>
<p>Let's consider the example of a type like <code>MyStruct&lt;u32&gt;</code>, where <code>MyStruct</code> is defined like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">struct MyStruct&lt;T&gt; { x: u32, y: T }
</code></pre>
<p>The type <code>MyStruct&lt;u32&gt;</code> would be an instance of <code>TyKind::Adt</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">Adt(&amp;'tcx AdtDef, SubstsRef&lt;'tcx&gt;)
//  ------------  ---------------
//  (1)            (2)
//
// (1) represents the `MyStruct` part
// (2) represents the `&lt;u32&gt;`, or &quot;substitutions&quot; / generic arguments
</code></pre>
<p>There are two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/struct.AdtDef.html"><code>AdtDef</code></a> references the struct/enum/union but without the values for its type
parameters. In our example, this is the <code>MyStruct</code> part <em>without</em> the argument <code>u32</code>.
(Note that in the HIR, structs, enums and unions are represented differently, but in <code>ty::Ty</code>,
they are all represented using <code>TyKind::Adt</code>.)</li>
<li>The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/subst/type.SubstsRef.html"><code>SubstsRef</code></a> is an interned list of values that are to be substituted for the
generic parameters.  In our example of <code>MyStruct&lt;u32&gt;</code>, we would end up with a list like <code>[u32]</code>.
We’ll dig more into generics and substitutions in a little bit.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><code>AdtDef</code> and <code>DefId</code></strong></p>
<p>For every type defined in the source code, there is a unique <code>DefId</code> (see <a href="hir.html#identifiers-in-the-hir">this
chapter</a>). This includes ADTs and generics. In the <code>MyStruct&lt;T&gt;</code>
definition we gave above, there are two <code>DefId</code>s: one for <code>MyStruct</code> and one for <code>T</code>.  Notice that
the code above does not generate a new <code>DefId</code> for <code>u32</code> because it is not defined in that code (it
is only referenced).</p>
<p><code>AdtDef</code> is more or less a wrapper around <code>DefId</code> with lots of useful helper methods. There is
essentially a one-to-one relationship between <code>AdtDef</code> and <code>DefId</code>. You can get the <code>AdtDef</code> for a
<code>DefId</code> with the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/struct.TyCtxt.html#method.adt_def"><code>tcx.adt_def(def_id)</code> query</a>. <code>AdtDef</code>s are all interned, as shown
by the <code>'tcx</code> lifetime.</p>
<h2 id="type-errors"><a class="header" href="#type-errors">Type errors</a></h2>
<p>There is a <code>TyKind::Error</code> that is produced when the user makes a type error. The idea is that
we would propagate this type and suppress other errors that come up due to it so as not to overwhelm
the user with cascading compiler error messages.</p>
<p>There is an <strong>important invariant</strong> for <code>TyKind::Error</code>. The compiler should
<strong>never</strong> produce <code>Error</code> unless we <strong>know</strong> that an error has already been
reported to the user. This is usually
because (a) you just reported it right there or (b) you are propagating an existing Error type (in
which case the error should've been reported when that error type was produced).</p>
<p>It's important to maintain this invariant because the whole point of the <code>Error</code> type is to suppress
other errors -- i.e., we don't report them. If we were to produce an <code>Error</code> type without actually
emitting an error to the user, then this could cause later errors to be suppressed, and the
compilation might inadvertently succeed!</p>
<p>Sometimes there is a third case. You believe that an error has been reported, but you believe it
would've been reported earlier in the compilation, not locally. In that case, you can invoke
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_session/struct.Session.html#method.delay_span_bug"><code>delay_span_bug</code></a> This will make a note that you expect compilation to yield an error -- if however
compilation should succeed, then it will trigger a compiler bug report.</p>
<p>For added safety, it's not actually possible to produce a <code>TyKind::Error</code> value
outside of <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/index.html"><code>rustc_middle::ty</code></a>; there is a private member of
<code>TyKind::Error</code> that prevents it from being constructable elsewhere. Instead,
one should use the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/struct.TyCtxt.html#method.ty_error"><code>TyCtxt::ty_error</code></a> or
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/struct.TyCtxt.html#method.ty_error_with_message"><code>TyCtxt::ty_error_with_message</code></a> methods. These methods automatically
call <code>delay_span_bug</code> before returning an interned <code>Ty</code> of kind <code>Error</code>. If you
were already planning to use <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_session/struct.Session.html#method.delay_span_bug"><code>delay_span_bug</code></a>, then you can just pass the
span and message to <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/struct.TyCtxt.html#method.ty_error_with_message"><code>ty_error_with_message</code></a> instead to avoid
delaying a redundant span bug.</p>
<h2 id="question-why-not-substitute-inside-the-adtdef"><a class="header" href="#question-why-not-substitute-inside-the-adtdef">Question: Why not substitute “inside” the <code>AdtDef</code>?</a></h2>
<p>Recall that we represent a generic struct with <code>(AdtDef, substs)</code>. So why bother with this scheme?</p>
<p>Well, the alternate way we could have chosen to represent types would be to always create a new,
fully-substituted form of the <code>AdtDef</code> where all the types are already substituted. This seems like
less of a hassle. However, the <code>(AdtDef, substs)</code> scheme has some advantages over this.</p>
<p>First, <code>(AdtDef, substs)</code> scheme has an efficiency win:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">struct MyStruct&lt;T&gt; {
  ... 100s of fields ...
}

// Want to do: MyStruct&lt;A&gt; ==&gt; MyStruct&lt;B&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>in an example like this, we can subst from <code>MyStruct&lt;A&gt;</code> to <code>MyStruct&lt;B&gt;</code> (and so on) very cheaply,
by just replacing the one reference to <code>A</code> with <code>B</code>. But if we eagerly substituted all the fields,
that could be a lot more work because we might have to go through all of the fields in the <code>AdtDef</code>
and update all of their types.</p>
<p>A bit more deeply, this corresponds to structs in Rust being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominal_type_system"><em>nominal</em> types</a> — which
means that they are defined by their <em>name</em> (and that their contents are then indexed from the
definition of that name, and not carried along “within” the type itself).</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="generics-and-substitutions"><a class="header" href="#generics-and-substitutions">Generics and substitutions</a></h1>
<p>Given a generic type <code>MyType&lt;A, B, …&gt;</code>, we may want to swap out the generics <code>A, B, …</code> for some
other types (possibly other generics or concrete types). We do this a lot while doing type
inference, type checking, and trait solving. Conceptually, during these routines, we may find out
that one type is equal to another type and want to swap one out for the other and then swap that out
for another type and so on until we eventually get some concrete types (or an error).</p>
<p>In rustc this is done using the <code>SubstsRef</code> that we mentioned above (“substs” = “substitutions”).
Conceptually, you can think of <code>SubstsRef</code> as a list of types that are to be substituted for the
generic type parameters of the ADT.</p>
<p><code>SubstsRef</code> is a type alias of <code>&amp;'tcx List&lt;GenericArg&lt;'tcx&gt;&gt;</code> (see <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/struct.List.html"><code>List</code> rustdocs</a>).
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/subst/struct.GenericArg.html"><code>GenericArg</code></a> is essentially a space-efficient wrapper around <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/subst/enum.GenericArgKind.html"><code>GenericArgKind</code></a>, which is an enum
indicating what kind of generic the type parameter is (type, lifetime, or const).  Thus, <code>SubstsRef</code>
is conceptually like a <code>&amp;'tcx [GenericArgKind&lt;'tcx&gt;]</code> slice (but it is actually a <code>List</code>).</p>
<p>So why do we use this <code>List</code> type instead of making it really a slice? It has the length &quot;inline&quot;,
so <code>&amp;List</code> is only 32 bits. As a consequence, it cannot be &quot;subsliced&quot; (that only works if the
length is out of line).</p>
<p>This also implies that you can check two <code>List</code>s for equality via <code>==</code> (which would be not be
possible for ordinary slices). This is precisely because they never represent a &quot;sub-list&quot;, only the
complete <code>List</code>, which has been hashed and interned.</p>
<p>So pulling it all together, let’s go back to our example above:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">struct MyStruct&lt;T&gt;
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>There would be an <code>AdtDef</code> (and corresponding <code>DefId</code>) for <code>MyStruct</code>.</li>
<li>There would be a <code>TyKind::Param</code> (and corresponding <code>DefId</code>) for <code>T</code> (more later).</li>
<li>There would be a <code>SubstsRef</code> containing the list <code>[GenericArgKind::Type(Ty(T))]</code>
<ul>
<li>The <code>Ty(T)</code> here is my shorthand for entire other <code>ty::Ty</code> that has <code>TyKind::Param</code>, which we
mentioned in the previous point.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This is one <code>TyKind::Adt</code> containing the <code>AdtDef</code> of <code>MyStruct</code> with the <code>SubstsRef</code> above.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, we will quickly mention the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/struct.Generics.html"><code>Generics</code></a> type. It
is used to give information about the type parameters of a type.</p>
<h3 id="unsubstituted-generics"><a class="header" href="#unsubstituted-generics">Unsubstituted Generics</a></h3>
<p>So above, recall that in our example the <code>MyStruct</code> struct had a generic type <code>T</code>. When we are (for
example) type checking functions that use <code>MyStruct</code>, we will need to be able to refer to this type
<code>T</code> without actually knowing what it is. In general, this is true inside all generic definitions: we
need to be able to work with unknown types. This is done via <code>TyKind::Param</code> (which we mentioned in
the example above).</p>
<p>Each <code>TyKind::Param</code> contains two things: the name and the index. In general, the index fully
defines the parameter and is used by most of the code. The name is included for debug print-outs.
There are two reasons for this. First, the index is convenient, it allows you to include into the
list of generic arguments when substituting. Second, the index is more robust. For example, you
could in principle have two distinct type parameters that use the same name, e.g. <code>impl&lt;A&gt; Foo&lt;A&gt; { fn bar&lt;A&gt;() { .. } }</code>, although the rules against shadowing make this difficult (but those language
rules could change in the future).</p>
<p>The index of the type parameter is an integer indicating its order in the list of the type
parameters. Moreover, we consider the list to include all of the type parameters from outer scopes.
Consider the following example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">struct Foo&lt;A, B&gt; {
  // A would have index 0
  // B would have index 1

  .. // some fields
}
impl&lt;X, Y&gt; Foo&lt;X, Y&gt; {
  fn method&lt;Z&gt;() {
    // inside here, X, Y and Z are all in scope
    // X has index 0
    // Y has index 1
    // Z has index 2
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>When we are working inside the generic definition, we will use <code>TyKind::Param</code> just like any other
<code>TyKind</code>; it is just a type after all. However, if we want to use the generic type somewhere, then
we will need to do substitutions.</p>
<p>For example suppose that the <code>Foo&lt;A, B&gt;</code> type from the previous example has a field that is a
<code>Vec&lt;A&gt;</code>. Observe that <code>Vec</code> is also a generic type. We want to tell the compiler that the type
parameter of <code>Vec</code> should be replaced with the <code>A</code> type parameter of <code>Foo&lt;A, B&gt;</code>. We do that with
substitutions:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">struct Foo&lt;A, B&gt; { // Adt(Foo, &amp;[Param(0), Param(1)])
  x: Vec&lt;A&gt;, // Adt(Vec, &amp;[Param(0)])
  ..
}

fn bar(foo: Foo&lt;u32, f32&gt;) { // Adt(Foo, &amp;[u32, f32])
  let y = foo.x; // Vec&lt;Param(0)&gt; =&gt; Vec&lt;u32&gt;
}
</code></pre>
<p>This example has a few different substitutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the definition of <code>Foo</code>, in the type of the field <code>x</code>, we replace <code>Vec</code>'s type parameter with
<code>Param(0)</code>, the first parameter of <code>Foo&lt;A, B&gt;</code>, so that the type of <code>x</code> is <code>Vec&lt;A&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>In the function <code>bar</code>, we specify that we want a <code>Foo&lt;u32, f32&gt;</code>. This means that we will
substitute <code>Param(0)</code> and <code>Param(1)</code> with <code>u32</code> and <code>f32</code>.</li>
<li>In the body of <code>bar</code>, we access <code>foo.x</code>, which has type <code>Vec&lt;Param(0)&gt;</code>, but <code>Param(0)</code> has been
substituted for <code>u32</code>, so <code>foo.x</code> has type <code>Vec&lt;u32&gt;</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s look a bit more closely at that last substitution to see why we use indexes. If we want to
find the type of <code>foo.x</code>, we can get generic type of <code>x</code>, which is <code>Vec&lt;Param(0)&gt;</code>. Now we can take
the index <code>0</code> and use it to find the right type substitution: looking at <code>Foo</code>'s <code>SubstsRef</code>, we
have the list <code>[u32, f32]</code> , since we want to replace index <code>0</code>, we take the 0-th index of this
list, which is <code>u32</code>. Voila!</p>
<p>You may have a couple of followup questions…</p>
<p><strong><code>type_of</code></strong> How do we get the “generic type of <code>x</code>&quot;? You can get the type of pretty much anything
with the   <code>tcx.type_of(def_id)</code> query. In this case, we would pass the <code>DefId</code> of the field <code>x</code>.
The <code>type_of</code> query always returns the definition with the generics that are in scope of the
definition. For example, <code>tcx.type_of(def_id_of_my_struct)</code> would return the “self-view” of
<code>MyStruct</code>: <code>Adt(Foo, &amp;[Param(0), Param(1)])</code>.</p>
<p><strong><code>subst</code></strong> How do we actually do the substitutions? There is a function for that too! You use
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/subst/struct.EarlyBinder.html#method.subst"><code>subst</code></a> to
replace a <code>SubstRef</code> with another list of types.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/0940040c0486a536be4f8685c7dd9a078f9e87c2/compiler/rustc_hir_analysis/src/astconv/mod.rs#L1231-L1242">Here is an example of actually using <code>subst</code> in the compiler</a>.  The exact details are not
too important, but in this piece of code, we happen to be converting from the <code>rustc_hir::Ty</code> to
a real <code>ty::Ty</code>. You can see that we first get some substitutions (<code>substs</code>).  Then we call
<code>type_of</code> to get a type and call <code>ty.subst(substs)</code> to get a new version of <code>ty</code> with
the substitutions made.</p>
<p><strong>Note on indices:</strong> It is possible for the indices in <code>Param</code> to not match with what we expect. For
example, the index could be out of bounds or it could be the index of a lifetime when we were
expecting a type. These sorts of errors would be caught earlier in the compiler when translating
from a <code>rustc_hir::Ty</code> to a <code>ty::Ty</code>. If they occur later, that is a compiler bug.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="typefoldable-and-typefolder"><a class="header" href="#typefoldable-and-typefolder"><code>TypeFoldable</code> and <code>TypeFolder</code></a></h1>
<p>How is this <code>subst</code> query actually implemented? As you can imagine, we might want to do
substitutions on a lot of different things. For example, we might want to do a substitution directly
on a type like we did with <code>Vec</code> above. But we might also have a more complex type with other types
nested inside that also need substitutions.</p>
<p>The answer is a couple of traits:
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/fold/trait.TypeFoldable.html"><code>TypeFoldable</code></a>
and
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/fold/trait.TypeFolder.html"><code>TypeFolder</code></a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>TypeFoldable</code> is implemented by types that embed type information. It allows you to recursively
process the contents of the <code>TypeFoldable</code> and do stuff to them.</li>
<li><code>TypeFolder</code> defines what you want to do with the types you encounter while processing the
<code>TypeFoldable</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the <code>TypeFolder</code> trait has a method
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/fold/trait.TypeFolder.html#method.fold_ty"><code>fold_ty</code></a>
that takes a type as input and returns a new type as a result. <code>TypeFoldable</code> invokes the
<code>TypeFolder</code> <code>fold_foo</code> methods on itself, giving the <code>TypeFolder</code> access to its contents (the
types, regions, etc that are contained within).</p>
<p>You can think of it with this analogy to the iterator combinators we have come to love in rust:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">vec.iter().map(|e1| foo(e2)).collect()
//             ^^^^^^^^^^^^ analogous to `TypeFolder`
//         ^^^ analogous to `TypeFoldable`
</code></pre>
<p>So to reiterate:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>TypeFolder</code>  is a trait that defines a “map” operation.</li>
<li><code>TypeFoldable</code>  is a trait that is implemented by things that embed types.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the case of <code>subst</code>, we can see that it is implemented as a <code>TypeFolder</code>:
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/subst/struct.SubstFolder.html"><code>SubstFolder</code></a>.
Looking at its implementation, we see where the actual substitutions are happening.</p>
<p>However, you might also notice that the implementation calls this <code>super_fold_with</code> method. What is
that? It is a method of <code>TypeFoldable</code>. Consider the following <code>TypeFoldable</code> type <code>MyFoldable</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">struct MyFoldable&lt;'tcx&gt; {
  def_id: DefId,
  ty: Ty&lt;'tcx&gt;,
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>TypeFolder</code> can call <code>super_fold_with</code> on <code>MyFoldable</code> if it just wants to replace some of the
fields of <code>MyFoldable</code> with new values. If it instead wants to replace the whole <code>MyFoldable</code> with a
different one, it would call <code>fold_with</code> instead (a different method on <code>TypeFoldable</code>).</p>
<p>In almost all cases, we don’t want to replace the whole struct; we only want to replace <code>ty::Ty</code>s in
the struct, so usually we call <code>super_fold_with</code>. A typical implementation that <code>MyFoldable</code> could
have might do something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">my_foldable: MyFoldable&lt;'tcx&gt;
my_foldable.subst(..., subst)

impl TypeFoldable for MyFoldable {
  fn super_fold_with(&amp;self, folder: &amp;mut impl TypeFolder&lt;'tcx&gt;) -&gt; MyFoldable {
    MyFoldable {
      def_id: self.def_id.fold_with(folder),
      ty: self.ty.fold_with(folder),
    }
  }

  fn super_visit_with(..) { }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that here, we implement <code>super_fold_with</code> to go over the fields of <code>MyFoldable</code> and call
<code>fold_with</code> on <em>them</em>. That is, a folder may replace  <code>def_id</code> and <code>ty</code>, but not the whole
<code>MyFoldable</code> struct.</p>
<p>Here is another example to put things together: suppose we have a type like <code>Vec&lt;Vec&lt;X&gt;&gt;</code>. The
<code>ty::Ty</code> would look like: <code>Adt(Vec, &amp;[Adt(Vec, &amp;[Param(X)])])</code>. If we want to do <code>subst(X =&gt; u32)</code>,
then we would first look at the overall type. We would see that there are no substitutions to be
made at the outer level, so we would descend one level and look at <code>Adt(Vec, &amp;[Param(X)])</code>. There
are still no substitutions to be made here, so we would descend again. Now we are looking at
<code>Param(X)</code>, which can be substituted, so we replace it with <code>u32</code>. We can’t descend any more, so we
are done, and  the overall result is <code>Adt(Vec, &amp;[Adt(Vec, &amp;[u32])])</code>.</p>
<p>One last thing to mention: often when folding over a <code>TypeFoldable</code>, we don’t want to change most
things. We only want to do something when we reach a type. That means there may be a lot of
<code>TypeFoldable</code> types whose implementations basically just forward to their fields’ <code>TypeFoldable</code>
implementations. Such implementations of <code>TypeFoldable</code> tend to be pretty tedious to write by hand.
For this reason, there is a <code>derive</code> macro that allows you to <code>#![derive(TypeFoldable)]</code>. It is
defined
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/compiler/rustc_macros/src/type_foldable.rs">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong><code>subst</code></strong> In the case of substitutions the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/75ff3110ac6d8a0259023b83fd20d7ab295f8dd6/src/librustc_middle/ty/subst.rs#L440-L451">actual
folder</a>
is going to be doing the indexing we’ve already mentioned. There we define a <code>Folder</code> and call
<code>fold_with</code> on the <code>TypeFoldable</code> to process yourself.  Then
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/75ff3110ac6d8a0259023b83fd20d7ab295f8dd6/src/librustc_middle/ty/subst.rs#L512-L536">fold_ty</a>
the method that process each type it looks for a <code>ty::Param</code> and for those it replaces it for
something from the list of substitutions, otherwise recursively process the type.  To replace it,
calls
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/75ff3110ac6d8a0259023b83fd20d7ab295f8dd6/src/librustc_middle/ty/subst.rs#L552-L587">ty_for_param</a>
and all that does is index into the list of substitutions with the index of the <code>Param</code>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="generic-arguments"><a class="header" href="#generic-arguments">Generic arguments</a></h1>
<p>A <code>ty::subst::GenericArg&lt;'tcx&gt;</code> represents some entity in the type system: a type
(<code>Ty&lt;'tcx&gt;</code>), lifetime (<code>ty::Region&lt;'tcx&gt;</code>) or constant (<code>ty::Const&lt;'tcx&gt;</code>).
<code>GenericArg</code> is used to perform substitutions of generic parameters for concrete
arguments, such as when calling a function with generic parameters explicitly
with type arguments. Substitutions are represented using the
<a href="generic_arguments.html#subst"><code>Subst</code> type</a> as described below.</p>
<h2 id="subst"><a class="header" href="#subst"><code>Subst</code></a></h2>
<p><code>ty::subst::Subst&lt;'tcx&gt;</code> is intuitively simply a slice of <code>GenericArg&lt;'tcx&gt;</code>s,
acting as an ordered list of substitutions from generic parameters to
concrete arguments (such as types, lifetimes and consts).</p>
<p>For example, given a <code>HashMap&lt;K, V&gt;</code> with two type parameters, <code>K</code> and <code>V</code>, an
instantiation of the parameters, for example <code>HashMap&lt;i32, u32&gt;</code>, would be
represented by the substitution <code>&amp;'tcx [tcx.types.i32, tcx.types.u32]</code>.</p>
<p><code>Subst</code> provides various convenience methods to instantiate substitutions
given item definitions, which should generally be used rather than explicitly
constructing such substitution slices.</p>
<h2 id="genericarg"><a class="header" href="#genericarg"><code>GenericArg</code></a></h2>
<p>The actual <code>GenericArg</code> struct is optimised for space, storing the type, lifetime or
const as an interned pointer containing a tag identifying its kind (in the
lowest 2 bits). Unless you are working with the <code>Subst</code> implementation
specifically, you should generally not have to deal with <code>GenericArg</code> and instead
make use of the safe <a href="generic_arguments.html#genericargkind"><code>GenericArgKind</code></a> abstraction.</p>
<h2 id="genericargkind"><a class="header" href="#genericargkind"><code>GenericArgKind</code></a></h2>
<p>As <code>GenericArg</code> itself is not type-safe, the <code>GenericArgKind</code> enum provides a more
convenient and safe interface for dealing with generic arguments. An
<code>GenericArgKind</code> can be converted to a raw <code>GenericArg</code> using <code>GenericArg::from()</code>
(or simply <code>.into()</code> when the context is clear). As mentioned earlier, substitution
lists store raw <code>GenericArg</code>s, so before dealing with them, it is preferable to
convert them to <code>GenericArgKind</code>s first. This is done by calling the <code>.unpack()</code>
method.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">// An example of unpacking and packing a generic argument.
fn deal_with_generic_arg&lt;'tcx&gt;(generic_arg: GenericArg&lt;'tcx&gt;) -&gt; GenericArg&lt;'tcx&gt; {

The variants of their <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/enum.ConstKind.html"><code>ty::ConstKind</code></a> mostly mirror the variants of <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/enum.TyKind.html"><code>ty::TyKind</code></a>

<p>To typecheck constants used in the type system, we have to know their expected type.
For const arguments in type dependent paths, e.g. <code>x.foo::&lt;{ 3 + 4 }&gt;()</code>, we don't know
the expected type for <code>{ 3 + 4 }</code> until we are typechecking the containing function.</p>
<p>As we may however have to evaluate that constant during this typecheck, we would get a cycle error.

<h2 id="unevaluated-constants"><a class="header" href="#unevaluated-constants">Unevaluated constants</a></h2>
<p><em>This section talks about what's happening with <code>feature(generic_const_exprs)</code> enabled.
On stable we do not yet supply any generic parameters to anonymous constants,
avoiding most of the issues mentioned here.</em></p>
<p>Unless a constant is either a simple literal, e.g. <code>[u8; 3]</code> or <code>foo::&lt;{ 'c' }&gt;()</code>,
or a generic parameter, e.g. <code>[u8; N]</code>, converting a constant to its <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/struct.Const.html"><code>ty::Const</code></a> representation
returns an unevaluated constant. Even fully concrete constants which do not depend on
generic parameters are not evaluated right away.</p>
<p>Anonymous constants are typechecked separately from their containing item, e.g.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>fn foo&lt;const N: usize&gt;() -&gt; [u8; N + 1] {

<h3 id="unifying-constants"><a class="header" href="#unifying-constants">Unifying constants</a></h3>
<p>For the compiler, <code>ANON_CONST_1</code> and <code>ANON_CONST_2</code> are completely different, so
we have to somehow look into unevaluated constants to check whether they should
unify.</p>
<p>For this we use <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_infer/infer/struct.InferCtxt.html#method.try_unify_abstract_consts">InferCtxt::try_unify_abstract_consts</a>.
This builds a custom AST for the two inputs from their THIR. This is then used for
the actual comparison.</p>
<h3 id="lazy-normalization-for-constants"><a class="header" href="#lazy-normalization-for-constants">Lazy normalization for constants</a></h3>
<p>We do not eagerly evaluate constant as they can be used in the <code>where</code>-clauses of their
parent item, for example:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {

where
    [u8; &lt;T as  Trait&gt;::ASSOC + 1]: SomeOtherTrait,
{}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The constant <code>&lt;T as  Trait&gt;::ASSOC + 1</code> depends on the <code>T: Trait</code> bound of
its parents caller bounds, but is also part of another bound itself.
If we were to eagerly evaluate this constant while computing its parents bounds
this would cause a query cycle.</p>
<h3 id="unused-generic-arguments-of-anonymous-constants"><a class="header" href="#unused-generic-arguments-of-anonymous-constants">Unused generic arguments of anonymous constants</a></h3>
<p>Anonymous constants inherit the generic parameters of their parent, which is
why the array length in <code>foo&lt;const N: usize&gt;() -&gt; [u8; N + 1]</code> can use <code>N</code>.</p>
<p>Without any manual adjustments, this causes us to include parameters even if
the constant doesn't use them in any way. This can cause

<p>Type inference is the process of automatic detection of the type of an
expression.</p>
<p>It is what allows Rust to work with fewer or no type annotations,
making things easier for users:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let mut things = vec![];
    things.push(&quot;thing&quot;);
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Here, the type of <code>things</code> is <em>inferred</em> to be <code>Vec&lt;&amp;str&gt;</code> because of the value
we push into <code>things</code>.</p>
<p>The type inference is based on the standard Hindley-Milner (HM) type inference
algorithm, but extended in various way to accommodate subtyping, region
inference, and higher-ranked types.</p>
<h2 id="a-note-on-terminology"><a class="header" href="#a-note-on-terminology">A note on terminology</a></h2>
<p>We use the notation <code>?T</code> to refer to inference variables, also called
existential variables.</p>
<p>We use the terms &quot;region&quot; and &quot;lifetime&quot; interchangeably. Both refer to
the <code>'a</code> in <code>&amp;'a T</code>.</p>
<p>The term &quot;bound region&quot; refers to a region that is bound in a function
signature, such as the <code>'a</code> in <code>for&lt;'a&gt; fn(&amp;'a u32)</code>. A region is
&quot;free&quot; if it is not bound.</p>
<h2 id="creating-an-inference-context"><a class="header" href="#creating-an-inference-context">Creating an inference context</a></h2>
<p>You create an inference context by doing something like
the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let infcx = tcx.infer_ctxt().build();
// Use the inference context `infcx` here.
</code></pre>
<p><code>infcx</code> has the type <code>InferCtxt&lt;'tcx&gt;</code>, the same <code>'tcx</code> lifetime as on
the <code>tcx</code> it was built from.</p>
<p>The <code>tcx.infer_ctxt</code> method actually returns a builder, which means
there are some kinds of configuration you can do before the <code>infcx</code> is
created. See <code>InferCtxtBuilder</code> for more information.</p>
<p><a name="vars"></a></p>
<h2 id="inference-variables"><a class="header" href="#inference-variables">Inference variables</a></h2>
<p>The main purpose of the inference context is to house a bunch of
<strong>inference variables</strong> – these represent types or regions whose precise
value is not yet known, but will be uncovered as we perform type-checking.</p>
<p>If you're familiar with the basic ideas of unification from H-M type
systems, or logic languages like Prolog, this is the same concept. If
you're not, you might want to read a tutorial on how H-M type
inference works, or perhaps this blog post on
<a href="http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2017/03/25/unification-in-chalk-part-1/">unification in the Chalk project</a>.</p>
<p>All told, the inference context stores five kinds of inference variables
(as of <!-- date-check --> June 2021):</p>
<ul>
<li>Type variables, which come in three varieties:
<ul>
<li>General type variables (the most common). These can be unified with any
type.</li>
<li>Integral type variables, which can only be unified with an integral type,
and arise from an integer literal expression like <code>22</code>.</li>
<li>Float type variables, which can only be unified with a float type, and
arise from a float literal expression like <code>22.0</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Region variables, which represent lifetimes, and arise all over the place.</li>
<li>Const variables, which represent constants.</li>
</ul>
<p>All the type variables work in much the same way: you can create a new
type variable, and what you get is <code>Ty&lt;'tcx&gt;</code> representing an
unresolved type <code>?T</code>. Then later you can apply the various operations
that the inferencer supports, such as equality or subtyping, and it
will possibly <strong>instantiate</strong> (or <strong>bind</strong>) that <code>?T</code> to a specific
value as a result.</p>
<p>The region variables work somewhat differently, and are described
below in a separate section.</p>
<h2 id="enforcing-equality--subtyping"><a class="header" href="#enforcing-equality--subtyping">Enforcing equality / subtyping</a></h2>
<p>The most basic operations you can perform in the type inferencer is
<strong>equality</strong>, which forces two types <code>T</code> and <code>U</code> to be the same. The
recommended way to add an equality constraint is to use the <code>at</code>
method, roughly like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">infcx.at(...).eq(t, u);
</code></pre>
<p>The first <code>at()</code> call provides a bit of context, i.e. why you are
doing this unification, and in what environment, and the <code>eq</code> method
performs the actual equality constraint.</p>
<p>When you equate things, you force them to be precisely equal. Equating
returns an <code>InferResult</code> – if it returns <code>Err(err)</code>, then equating
failed, and the enclosing <code>TypeError</code> will tell you what went wrong.</p>
<p>The success case is perhaps more interesting. The &quot;primary&quot; return
type of <code>eq</code> is <code>()</code> – that is, when it succeeds, it doesn't return a
value of any particular interest. Rather, it is executed for its
side-effects of constraining type variables and so forth. However, the
actual return type is not <code>()</code>, but rather <code>InferOk&lt;()&gt;</code>. The
<code>InferOk</code> type is used to carry extra trait obligations – your job is
to ensure that these are fulfilled (typically by enrolling them in a
fulfillment context). See the <a href="traits/resolution.html">trait chapter</a> for more background on that.</p>
<p>You can similarly enforce subtyping through <code>infcx.at(..).sub(..)</code>. The same
basic concepts as above apply.</p>
<h2 id="trying-equality"><a class="header" href="#trying-equality">&quot;Trying&quot; equality</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes you would like to know if it is <em>possible</em> to equate two
types without error.  You can test that with <code>infcx.can_eq</code> (or
<code>infcx.can_sub</code> for subtyping). If this returns <code>Ok</code>, then equality
is possible – but in all cases, any side-effects are reversed.</p>
<p>Be aware, though, that the success or failure of these methods is always
<strong>modulo regions</strong>. That is, two types <code>&amp;'a u32</code> and <code>&amp;'b u32</code> will
return <code>Ok</code> for <code>can_eq</code>, even if <code>'a != 'b</code>.  This falls out from the
&quot;two-phase&quot; nature of how we solve region constraints.</p>
<h2 id="snapshots"><a class="header" href="#snapshots">Snapshots</a></h2>
<p>As described in the previous section on <code>can_eq</code>, often it is useful
to be able to do a series of operations and then roll back their
side-effects. This is done for various reasons: one of them is to be
able to backtrack, trying out multiple possibilities before settling
on which path to take. Another is in order to ensure that a series of
smaller changes take place atomically or not at all.</p>
<p>To allow for this, the inference context supports a <code>snapshot</code> method.
When you call it, it will start recording changes that occur from the
operations you perform. When you are done, you can either invoke
<code>rollback_to</code>, which will undo those changes, or else <code>confirm</code>, which
will make them permanent. Snapshots can be nested as long as you follow
a stack-like discipline.</p>
<p>Rather than use snapshots directly, it is often helpful to use the
methods like <code>commit_if_ok</code> or <code>probe</code> that encapsulate higher-level
patterns.</p>
<h2 id="subtyping-obligations"><a class="header" href="#subtyping-obligations">Subtyping obligations</a></h2>
<p>One thing worth discussing is subtyping obligations. When you force
two types to be a subtype, like <code>?T &lt;: i32</code>, we can often convert those
into equality constraints. This follows from Rust's rather limited notion
of subtyping: so, in the above case, <code>?T &lt;: i32</code> is equivalent to <code>?T = i32</code>.</p>
<p>However, in some cases we have to be more careful. For example, when
regions are involved. So if you have <code>?T &lt;: &amp;'a i32</code>, what we would do
is to first &quot;generalize&quot; <code>&amp;'a i32</code> into a type with a region variable:
<code>&amp;'?b i32</code>, and then unify <code>?T</code> with that (<code>?T = &amp;'?b i32</code>). We then
relate this new variable with the original bound:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">&amp;'?b i32 &lt;: &amp;'a i32
</code></pre>
<p>This will result in a region constraint (see below) of <code>'?b: 'a</code>.</p>
<p>One final interesting case is relating two unbound type variables,
like <code>?T &lt;: ?U</code>.  In that case, we can't make progress, so we enqueue
an obligation <code>Subtype(?T, ?U)</code> and return it via the <code>InferOk</code>
mechanism. You'll have to try again when more details about <code>?T</code> or
<code>?U</code> are known.</p>
<h2 id="region-constraints"><a class="header" href="#region-constraints">Region constraints</a></h2>
<p>Regions are inferenced somewhat differently from types. Rather than
eagerly unifying things, we simply collect constraints as we go, but
make (almost) no attempt to solve regions. These constraints have the
form of an &quot;outlives&quot; constraint:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">'a: 'b
</code></pre>
<p>Actually the code tends to view them as a subregion relation, but it's the same
idea:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">'b &lt;= 'a
</code></pre>
<p>(There are various other kinds of constraints, such as &quot;verifys&quot;; see
the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_infer/infer/region_constraints/index.html"><code>region_constraints</code></a> module for details.)</p>
<p>There is one case where we do some amount of eager unification. If you have an
equality constraint between two regions</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">'a = 'b
</code></pre>
<p>we will record that fact in a unification table. You can then use
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_infer/infer/region_constraints/struct.RegionConstraintCollector.html#method.opportunistic_resolve_var"><code>opportunistic_resolve_var</code></a> to convert <code>'b</code> to <code>'a</code> (or vice
versa). This is sometimes needed to ensure termination of fixed-point
algorithms.</p>
<h2 id="solving-region-constraints"><a class="header" href="#solving-region-constraints">Solving region constraints</a></h2>
<p>Region constraints are only solved at the very end of
typechecking, once all other constraints are known and
all other obligations have been proven. There are two
ways to solve region constraints right now: lexical and
non-lexical. Eventually there will only be one.</p>
<p>An exception here is the leak-check which is used during trait solving
and relies on region constraints containing higher-ranked regions. Region
constraints in the root universe (i.e. not arising from a <code>for&lt;'a&gt;</code>) must
not influence the trait system, as these regions are all erased during
codegen.</p>
<p>To solve <strong>lexical</strong> region constraints, you invoke
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_infer/infer/struct.InferCtxt.html#method.resolve_regions_and_report_errors"><code>resolve_regions_and_report_errors</code></a>.  This &quot;closes&quot; the region
constraint process and invokes the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_infer/infer/lexical_region_resolve/index.html"><code>lexical_region_resolve</code></a> code. Once
this is done, any further attempt to equate or create a subtyping
relationship will yield an ICE.</p>
<p>The NLL solver (actually, the MIR type-checker) does things slightly
differently. It uses canonical queries for trait solving which use
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_infer/infer/struct.InferCtxt.html#method.take_and_reset_region_constraints"><code>take_and_reset_region_constraints</code></a> at the end. This extracts all of the
outlives constraints added during the canonical query. This is required
as the NLL solver must not only know <em>what</em> regions outlive each other,
but also <em>where</em>. Finally, the NLL solver invokes <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_infer/infer/struct.InferCtxt.html#method.take_region_var_origins"><code>take_region_var_origins</code></a>,
providing all region variables to the solver.</p>
<h2 id="lexical-region-resolution"><a class="header" href="#lexical-region-resolution">Lexical region resolution</a></h2>
<p>Lexical region resolution is done by initially assigning each region
variable to an empty value. We then process each outlives constraint
repeatedly, growing region variables until a fixed-point is reached.
Region variables can be grown using a least-upper-bound relation on
the region lattice in a fairly straightforward fashion.</p>

<p>This chapter describes the general process of <em>trait resolution</em> and points out
some non-obvious things.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This chapter (and its subchapters) describe how the trait
solver <strong>currently</strong> works. However, we are in the process of
designing a new trait solver. If you'd prefer to read about <em>that</em>,
see <a href="traits/./chalk.html"><em>this</em> subchapter</a>.</p>
<h2 id="major-concepts"><a class="header" href="#major-concepts">Major concepts</a></h2>
<p>Trait resolution is the process of pairing up an impl with each
reference to a trait. So, for example, if there is a generic function like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn clone_slice&lt;T:Clone&gt;(x: &amp;[T]) -&gt; Vec&lt;T&gt; { ... }
</code></pre>
<p>and then a call to that function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let v: Vec&lt;isize&gt; = clone_slice(&amp;[1, 2, 3])
</code></pre>
<p>it is the job of trait resolution to figure out whether there exists an impl of
(in this case) <code>isize : Clone</code>.</p>
<p>Note that in some cases, like generic functions, we may not be able to
find a specific impl, but we can figure out that the caller must
provide an impl. For example, consider the body of <code>clone_slice</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn clone_slice&lt;T:Clone&gt;(x: &amp;[T]) -&gt; Vec&lt;T&gt; {
    let mut v = Vec::new();
    for e in &amp;x {
        v.push((*e).clone()); // (*)
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The line marked <code>(*)</code> is only legal if <code>T</code> (the type of <code>*e</code>)
implements the <code>Clone</code> trait. Naturally, since we don't know what <code>T</code>
is, we can't find the specific impl; but based on the bound <code>T:Clone</code>,
we can say that there exists an impl which the caller must provide.</p>
<p>We use the term <em>obligation</em> to refer to a trait reference in need of
an impl. Basically, the trait resolution system resolves an obligation
by proving that an appropriate impl does exist.</p>
<p>During type checking, we do not store the results of trait selection.
We simply wish to verify that trait selection will succeed. Then
later, at codegen time, when we have all concrete types available, we
can repeat the trait selection to choose an actual implementation, which
will then be generated in the output binary.</p>
<h2 id="overview-3"><a class="header" href="#overview-3">Overview</a></h2>
<p>Trait resolution consists of three major parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Selection</strong>: Deciding how to resolve a specific obligation. For
example, selection might decide that a specific obligation can be
resolved by employing an impl which matches the <code>Self</code> type, or by using a
parameter bound (e.g. <code>T: Trait</code>). In the case of an impl, selecting one
obligation can create <em>nested obligations</em> because of where clauses
on the impl itself. It may also require evaluating those nested
obligations to resolve ambiguities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fulfillment</strong>: The fulfillment code is what tracks that obligations
are completely fulfilled. Basically it is a worklist of obligations
to be selected: once selection is successful, the obligation is
removed from the worklist and any nested obligations are enqueued.
Fulfillment constrains inference variables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Evaluation</strong>: Checks whether obligations holds without constraining
any inference variables. Used by selection.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="selection"><a class="header" href="#selection">Selection</a></h2>
<p>Selection is the process of deciding whether an obligation can be
resolved and, if so, how it is to be resolved (via impl, where clause, etc).
The main interface is the <code>select()</code> function, which takes an obligation
and returns a <code>SelectionResult</code>. There are three possible outcomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Ok(Some(selection))</code> – yes, the obligation can be resolved, and
<code>selection</code> indicates how. If the impl was resolved via an impl,
then <code>selection</code> may also indicate nested obligations that are required
by the impl.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Ok(None)</code> – we are not yet sure whether the obligation can be
resolved or not. This happens most commonly when the obligation
contains unbound type variables.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Err(err)</code> – the obligation definitely cannot be resolved due to a
type error or because there are no impls that could possibly apply.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The basic algorithm for selection is broken into two big phases:
candidate assembly and confirmation.</p>
<p>Note that because of how lifetime inference works, it is not possible to
give back immediate feedback as to whether a unification or subtype
relationship between lifetimes holds or not. Therefore, lifetime
matching is <em>not</em> considered during selection. This is reflected in
the fact that subregion assignment is infallible. This may yield
lifetime constraints that will later be found to be in error (in
contrast, the non-lifetime-constraints have already been checked
during selection and can never cause an error, though naturally they
may lead to other errors downstream).</p>
<h3 id="candidate-assembly"><a class="header" href="#candidate-assembly">Candidate assembly</a></h3>
<p><strong>TODO</strong>: Talk about <em>why</em> we have different candidates, and why it needs to happen in a probe.</p>
<p>Searches for impls/where-clauses/etc that might
possibly be used to satisfy the obligation. Each of those is called
a candidate. To avoid ambiguity, we want to find exactly one
candidate that is definitively applicable. In some cases, we may not
know whether an impl/where-clause applies or not – this occurs when
the obligation contains unbound inference variables.</p>
<p>The subroutines that decide whether a particular impl/where-clause/etc applies
to a particular obligation are collectively referred to as the process of
<em>matching</em>. For <code>impl</code> candidates <!-- date-check: Oct 2022 -->,
this amounts to unifying the impl header (the <code>Self</code> type and the trait arguments)
while ignoring  nested obligations. If matching succeeds then we add it
to a set of candidates. There are other rules when assembling candidates for
built-in traits such as <code>Copy</code>, <code>Sized</code>, and <code>CoerceUnsized</code>.</p>
<p>Once this first pass is done, we can examine the set of candidates. If
it is a singleton set, then we are done: this is the only impl in
scope that could possibly apply. Otherwise, we can <strong>winnow</strong> down the set
of candidates by using where clauses and other conditions. Winnowing uses
<code>evaluate_candidate</code> to check whether the nested obligations may apply. 
If this still leaves more than 1 candidate, we use <code> fn candidate_should_be_dropped_in_favor_of</code> 
to prefer some candidates over others. </p>
<p>If this reduced set yields a single, unambiguous entry, we're good to go,
otherwise the result is considered ambiguous.</p>
<h4 id="winnowing-resolving-ambiguities"><a class="header" href="#winnowing-resolving-ambiguities">Winnowing: Resolving ambiguities</a></h4>
<p>But what happens if there are multiple impls where all the types
unify? Consider this example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">trait Get {
    fn get(&amp;self) -&gt; Self;
}

impl&lt;T: Copy&gt; Get for T {
    fn get(&amp;self) -&gt; T {
        *self
    }
}

impl&lt;T: Get&gt; Get for Box&lt;T&gt; {
    fn get(&amp;self) -&gt; Box&lt;T&gt; {
        Box::new(&lt;T&gt;::get(self))
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>What happens when we invoke <code>get(&amp;Box::new(1_u16))</code>, for example? In this
case, the <code>Self</code> type is <code>Box&lt;u16&gt;</code> – that unifies with both impls,
because the first applies to all types <code>T</code>, and the second to all
<code>Box&lt;T&gt;</code>. In order for this to be unambiguous, the compiler does a <em>winnowing</em>
pass that considers <code>where</code> clauses
and attempts to remove candidates. In this case, the first impl only
applies if <code>Box&lt;u16&gt; : Copy</code>, which doesn't hold. After winnowing,
then, we are left with just one candidate, so we can proceed.</p>
<h4 id="where-clauses"><a class="header" href="#where-clauses"><code>where</code> clauses</a></h4>
<p>Besides an impl, the other major way to resolve an obligation is via a
where clause. The selection process is always given a <a href="traits/../param_env.html">parameter
environment</a> which contains a list of where clauses, which are
basically obligations that we can assume are satisfiable. We will iterate
over that list and check whether our current obligation can be found
in that list. If so, it is considered satisfied. More precisely, we
want to check whether there is a where-clause obligation that is for
the same trait (or some subtrait) and which can match against the obligation.</p>
<p>Consider this simple example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">trait A1 {
    fn do_a1(&amp;self);
}
trait A2 : A1 { ... }

trait B {
    fn do_b(&amp;self);
}

fn foo&lt;X:A2+B&gt;(x: X) {
    x.do_a1(); // (*)
    x.do_b();  // (#)
}
</code></pre>
<p>In the body of <code>foo</code>, clearly we can use methods of <code>A1</code>, <code>A2</code>, or <code>B</code>
on variable <code>x</code>. The line marked <code>(*)</code> will incur an obligation <code>X: A1</code>,
while the line marked <code>(#)</code> will incur an obligation <code>X: B</code>. Meanwhile,
the parameter environment will contain two where-clauses: <code>X : A2</code> and <code>X : B</code>.
For each obligation, then, we search this list of where-clauses. The
obligation <code>X: B</code> trivially matches against the where-clause <code>X: B</code>.
To resolve an obligation <code>X:A1</code>, we would note that <code>X:A2</code> implies that <code>X:A1</code>.</p>
<h3 id="confirmation"><a class="header" href="#confirmation">Confirmation</a></h3>
<p><em>Confirmation</em> unifies the output type parameters of the trait with the
values found in the obligation, possibly yielding a type error.</p>
<p>Suppose we have the following variation of the <code>Convert</code> example in the
previous section:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">trait Convert&lt;Target&gt; {
    fn convert(&amp;self) -&gt; Target;
}

impl Convert&lt;usize&gt; for isize { ... } // isize -&gt; usize
impl Convert&lt;isize&gt; for usize { ... } // usize -&gt; isize

let x: isize = ...;
let y: char = x.convert(); // NOTE: `y: char` now!
</code></pre>
<p>Confirmation is where an error would be reported because the impl specified
that <code>Target</code> would be <code>usize</code>, but the obligation reported <code>char</code>. Hence the
result of selection would be an error.</p>
<p>Note that the candidate impl is chosen based on the <code>Self</code> type, but
confirmation is done based on (in this case) the <code>Target</code> type parameter.</p>
<h3 id="selection-during-codegen"><a class="header" href="#selection-during-codegen">Selection during codegen</a></h3>
<p>As mentioned above, during type checking, we do not store the results of trait
selection. At codegen time, we repeat the trait selection to choose a particular
impl for each method call. This is done using <code>fn codegen_select_candidate</code>. 
In this second selection, we do not consider any where-clauses to be in scope 
because we know that each resolution will resolve to a particular impl.</p>
<p>One interesting twist has to do with nested obligations. In general, in codegen,
we only to figure out which candidate applies, we do not care about nested obligations,
as these are already assumed to be true. Nonetheless, we <em>do</em> currently fulfill all of them.
That is because it can sometimes inform the results of type inference.
That is, we do not have the full substitutions in terms of the type variables
of the impl available to us, so we must run trait selection to figure
everything out.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="early-and-late-bound-variables"><a class="header" href="#early-and-late-bound-variables">Early and Late Bound Variables</a></h1>
<p>In Rust, item definitions (like <code>fn</code>) can often have generic parameters, which
are always <a href="./appendix/background.html#quantified"><em>universally</em> quantified</a>. That is, if you have a function
like</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>fn foo&lt;T&gt;(x: T) { }
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>this function is defined &quot;for all T&quot; (not &quot;for some specific T&quot;, which would be
<a href="./appendix/background.html#quantified"><em>existentially</em> quantified</a>).</p>
<p>While Rust <em>items</em> can be quantified over types, lifetimes, and constants, the
types of values in Rust are only ever quantified over lifetimes. So you can
have a type like <code>for&lt;'a&gt; fn(&amp;'a u32)</code>, which represents a function pointer
that takes a reference with any lifetime, or <code>for&lt;'a&gt; dyn Trait&lt;'a&gt;</code>, which is
a <code>dyn</code> trait for a trait implemented for any lifetime; but we have no type
like <code>for&lt;T&gt; fn(T)</code>, which would be a function that takes a value of <em>any type</em>
as a parameter. This is a consequence of monomorphization -- to support a value
of type <code>for&lt;T&gt; fn(T)</code>, we would need a single function pointer that can be
used for a parameter of any type, but in Rust we generate customized code for
each parameter type.</p>
<p>One consequence of this asymmetry is a weird split in how we represent some
generic types: <em>early-</em> and <em>late-</em> bound parameters.
Basically, if we cannot represent a type (e.g. a universally quantified type),
we have to bind it <em>early</em> so that the unrepresentable type is never around.</p>
<p>Consider the following example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn foo&lt;'a, 'b, T&gt;(x: &amp;'a u32, y: &amp;'b T) where T: 'b { ... }
</code></pre>
<p>We cannot treat <code>'a</code>, <code>'b</code>, and <code>T</code> in the same way.  Types in Rust can't have
<code>for&lt;T&gt; { .. }</code>, only <code>for&lt;'a&gt; {...}</code>, so whenever you reference <code>foo</code> the type
you get back can't be <code>for&lt;'a, 'b, T&gt; fn(&amp;'a u32, y: &amp;'b T)</code>. Instead, the <code>T</code>
must be substituted early. In particular, you have:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let x = foo; // T, 'b have to be substituted here
x(...);      // 'a substituted here, at the point of call
x(...);      // 'a substituted here with a different value
</code></pre>
<h2 id="early-bound-parameters"><a class="header" href="#early-bound-parameters">Early-bound parameters</a></h2>
<p>Early-bound parameters in rustc are identified by an index, stored in the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/struct.ParamTy.html"><code>ParamTy</code></a> struct for types or the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/struct.EarlyBoundRegion.html"><code>EarlyBoundRegion</code></a> struct for lifetimes.
The index counts from the outermost declaration in scope. This means that as you
add more binders inside, the index doesn't change.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">trait Foo&lt;T&gt; {
  type Bar&lt;U&gt; = (Self, T, U);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here, the type <code>(Self, T, U)</code> would be <code>($0, $1, $2)</code>, where <code>$N</code> means a
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/struct.ParamTy.html"><code>ParamTy</code></a> with the index of <code>N</code>.</p>
<p>In rustc, the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/struct.Generics.html"><code>Generics</code></a> structure carries this information. So the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/struct.Generics.html"><code>Generics</code></a> for <code>Bar</code> above would be just like for <code>U</code> and would indicate the
'parent' generics of <code>Foo</code>, which declares <code>Self</code> and <code>T</code>.  You can read more
in <a href="./generics.html">this chapter</a>.</p>
<h2 id="late-bound-parameters"><a class="header" href="#late-bound-parameters">Late-bound parameters</a></h2>
<p>Late-bound parameters in <code>rustc</code> are handled quite differently (they are also
specialized to lifetimes since, right now, only late-bound lifetimes are
supported, though with GATs that has to change). We indicate their potential
presence by a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/struct.Binder.html"><code>Binder</code></a> type. The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/struct.Binder.html"><code>Binder</code></a> doesn't know how many variables
there are at that binding level. This can only be determined by walking the
type itself and collecting them. So a type like <code>for&lt;'a, 'b&gt; ('a, 'b)</code> would be
<code>for (^0.a, ^0.b)</code>. Here, we just write <code>for</code> because we don't know the names
of the things bound within.</p>
<p>Moreover, a reference to a late-bound lifetime is written <code>^0.a</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>0</code> is the index; it identifies that this lifetime is bound in the
innermost binder (the <code>for</code>).</li>
<li>The <code>a</code> is the &quot;name&quot;; late-bound lifetimes in rustc are identified by a
&quot;name&quot; -- the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/enum.BoundRegionKind.html"><code>BoundRegionKind</code></a> enum. This enum can contain a
<a href="./hir.html#identifiers-in-the-hir"><code>DefId</code></a> or it might have various &quot;anonymous&quot; numbered names. The
latter arise from types like <code>fn(&amp;u32, &amp;u32)</code>, which are equivalent to
something like <code>for&lt;'a, 'b&gt; fn(&amp;'a u32, &amp;'b u32)</code>, but the names of those
lifetimes must be generated.</li>
</ul>
<p>This setup of not knowing the full set of variables at a binding level has some
advantages and some disadvantages. The disadvantage is that you must walk the
type to find out what is bound at the given level and so forth. The advantage
is primarily that, when constructing types from Rust syntax, if we encounter
anonymous regions like in <code>fn(&amp;u32)</code>, we just create a fresh index and don't have
to update the binder.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="higher-ranked-trait-bounds"><a class="header" href="#higher-ranked-trait-bounds">Higher-ranked trait bounds</a></h1>
<p>One of the more subtle concepts in trait resolution is <em>higher-ranked trait
bounds</em>. An example of such a bound is <code>for&lt;'a&gt; MyTrait&lt;&amp;'a isize&gt;</code>.
Let's walk through how selection on higher-ranked trait references
works.</p>
<h2 id="basic-matching-and-placeholder-leaks"><a class="header" href="#basic-matching-and-placeholder-leaks">Basic matching and placeholder leaks</a></h2>
<p>Suppose we have a trait <code>Foo</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>trait Foo&lt;X&gt; {
    fn foo(&amp;self, x: X) { }
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Let's say we have a function <code>want_hrtb</code> that wants a type which
implements <code>Foo&lt;&amp;'a isize&gt;</code> for any <code>'a</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn want_hrtb&lt;T&gt;() where T : for&lt;'a&gt; Foo&lt;&amp;'a isize&gt; { ... }
</code></pre>
<p>Now we have a struct <code>AnyInt</code> that implements <code>Foo&lt;&amp;'a isize&gt;</code> for any
<code>'a</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">struct AnyInt;
impl&lt;'a&gt; Foo&lt;&amp;'a isize&gt; for AnyInt { }
</code></pre>
<p>And the question is, does <code>AnyInt : for&lt;'a&gt; Foo&lt;&amp;'a isize&gt;</code>? We want the
answer to be yes. The algorithm for figuring it out is closely related
to the subtyping for higher-ranked types (which is described <a href="traits/./hrtb.html">here</a>
and also in a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/practical-type-inference-for-arbitrary-rank-types">paper by SPJ</a>. If you wish to understand higher-ranked
subtyping, we recommend you read the paper). There are a few parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Replace bound regions in the obligation with placeholders.</li>
<li>Match the impl against the <a href="traits/../appendix/glossary.html#placeholder">placeholder</a> obligation.</li>
<li>Check for <em>placeholder leaks</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>So let's work through our example.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The first thing we would do is to
replace the bound region in the obligation with a placeholder, yielding 
<code>AnyInt : Foo&lt;&amp;'0 isize&gt;</code> (here <code>'0</code> represents placeholder region #0). 
Note that we now have no quantifiers;
in terms of the compiler type, this changes from a <code>ty::PolyTraitRef</code>
to a <code>TraitRef</code>. We would then create the <code>TraitRef</code> from the impl,
using fresh variables for it's bound regions (and thus getting
<code>Foo&lt;&amp;'$a isize&gt;</code>, where <code>'$a</code> is the inference variable for <code>'a</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next
we relate the two trait refs, yielding a graph with the constraint
that <code>'0 == '$a</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, we check for placeholder &quot;leaks&quot; – a
leak is basically any attempt to relate a placeholder region to another
placeholder region, or to any region that pre-existed the impl match.
The leak check is done by searching from the placeholder region to find
the set of regions that it is related to in any way. This is called
the &quot;taint&quot; set. To pass the check, that set must consist <em>solely</em> of
itself and region variables from the impl. If the taint set includes
any other region, then the match is a failure. In this case, the taint
set for <code>'0</code> is <code>{'0, '$a}</code>, and hence the check will succeed.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's consider a failure case. Imagine we also have a struct</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">struct StaticInt;
impl Foo&lt;&amp;'static isize&gt; for StaticInt;
</code></pre>
<p>We want the obligation <code>StaticInt : for&lt;'a&gt; Foo&lt;&amp;'a isize&gt;</code> to be
considered unsatisfied. The check begins just as before. <code>'a</code> is
replaced with a placeholder <code>'0</code> and the impl trait reference is instantiated to
<code>Foo&lt;&amp;'static isize&gt;</code>. When we relate those two, we get a constraint
like <code>'static == '0</code>. This means that the taint set for <code>'0</code> is <code>{'0, 'static}</code>, which fails the leak check.</p>
<p><strong>TODO</strong>: This is because <code>'static</code> is not a region variable but is in the
taint set, right?</p>
<h2 id="higher-ranked-trait-obligations"><a class="header" href="#higher-ranked-trait-obligations">Higher-ranked trait obligations</a></h2>
<p>Once the basic matching is done, we get to another interesting topic:
how to deal with impl obligations. I'll work through a simple example
here. Imagine we have the traits <code>Foo</code> and <code>Bar</code> and an associated impl:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>trait Foo&lt;X&gt; {
    fn foo(&amp;self, x: X) { }
}

trait Bar&lt;X&gt; {
    fn bar(&amp;self, x: X) { }
}

impl&lt;X,F&gt; Foo&lt;X&gt; for F
    where F : Bar&lt;X&gt;
{
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Now let's say we have an obligation <code>Baz: for&lt;'a&gt; Foo&lt;&amp;'a isize&gt;</code> and we match
this impl. What obligation is generated as a result? We want to get
<code>Baz: for&lt;'a&gt; Bar&lt;&amp;'a isize&gt;</code>, but how does that happen?</p>
<p>After the matching, we are in a position where we have a placeholder
substitution like <code>X =&gt; &amp;'0 isize</code>. If we apply this substitution to the
impl obligations, we get <code>F : Bar&lt;&amp;'0 isize&gt;</code>. Obviously this is not
directly usable because the placeholder region <code>'0</code> cannot leak out of
our computation.</p>
<p>What we do is to create an inverse mapping from the taint set of <code>'0</code>
back to the original bound region (<code>'a</code>, here) that <code>'0</code> resulted
from. (This is done in <code>higher_ranked::plug_leaks</code>). We know that the
leak check passed, so this taint set consists solely of the placeholder
region itself plus various intermediate region variables. We then walk
the trait-reference and convert every region in that taint set back to
a late-bound region, so in this case we'd wind up with
<code>Baz: for&lt;'a&gt; Bar&lt;&amp;'a isize&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>In general, we attempt to cache the results of trait selection.  This
is a somewhat complex process. Part of the reason for this is that we
want to be able to cache results even when all the types in the trait
reference are not fully known. In that case, it may happen that the
trait selection process is also influencing type variables, so we have
to be able to not only cache the <em>result</em> of the selection process,
but <em>replay</em> its effects on the type variables.</p>
<h2 id="an-example"><a class="header" href="#an-example">An example</a></h2>
<p>The high-level idea of how the cache works is that we first replace
all unbound inference variables with placeholder versions. Therefore,
if we had a trait reference <code>usize : Foo&lt;$t&gt;</code>, where <code>$t</code> is an unbound
inference variable, we might replace it with <code>usize : Foo&lt;$0&gt;</code>, where
<code>$0</code> is a placeholder type. We would then look this up in the cache.</p>
<p>If we found a hit, the hit would tell us the immediate next step to
take in the selection process (e.g. apply impl #22, or apply where
clause <code>X : Foo&lt;Y&gt;</code>).</p>
<p>On the other hand, if there is no hit, we need to go through the <a href="traits/./resolution.html#selection">selection
process</a> from scratch. Suppose, we come to the conclusion that the only
possible impl is this one, with def-id 22:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">impl Foo&lt;isize&gt; for usize { ... } // Impl #22
</code></pre>
<p>We would then record in the cache <code>usize : Foo&lt;$0&gt; =&gt; ImplCandidate(22)</code>. Next
we would <a href="traits/./resolution.html#confirmation">confirm</a> <code>ImplCandidate(22)</code>, which would (as a side-effect) unify
<code>$t</code> with <code>isize</code>.</p>
<p>Now, at some later time, we might come along and see a <code>usize : Foo&lt;$u&gt;</code>. When replaced with a placeholder, this would yield <code>usize : Foo&lt;$0&gt;</code>, just as
before, and hence the cache lookup would succeed, yielding
<code>ImplCandidate(22)</code>. We would confirm <code>ImplCandidate(22)</code> which would
(as a side-effect) unify <code>$u</code> with <code>isize</code>.</p>
<h2 id="where-clauses-and-the-local-vs-global-cache"><a class="header" href="#where-clauses-and-the-local-vs-global-cache">Where clauses and the local vs global cache</a></h2>
<p>One subtle interaction is that the results of trait lookup will vary
depending on what where clauses are in scope. Therefore, we actually
have <em>two</em> caches, a local and a global cache. The local cache is
attached to the <a href="traits/../param_env.html"><code>ParamEnv</code></a>, and the global cache attached to the
<a href="traits/../ty.html"><code>tcx</code></a>. We use the local cache whenever the result might depend on the
where clauses that are in scope. The determination of which cache to
use is done by the method <code>pick_candidate_cache</code> in <code>select.rs</code>. At
the moment, we use a very simple, conservative rule: if there are any
where-clauses in scope, then we use the local cache.  We used to try
and draw finer-grained distinctions, but that led to a series of
annoying and weird bugs like <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/22019">#22019</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/18290">#18290</a>. This simple rule seems
to be pretty clearly safe and also still retains a very high hit rate
(~95% when compiling rustc).</p>
<p><strong>TODO</strong>: it looks like <code>pick_candidate_cache</code> no longer exists. In
general, is this section still accurate at all?</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="specialization-1"><a class="header" href="#specialization-1">Specialization</a></h1>
<p><strong>TODO</strong>: where does Chalk fit in? Should we mention/discuss it here?</p>
<p>Defined in the <code>specialize</code> module.</p>
<p>The basic strategy is to build up a <em>specialization graph</em> during
coherence checking (recall that coherence checking looks for overlapping
impls). Insertion into the graph locates the right place
to put an impl in the specialization hierarchy; if there is no right
place (due to partial overlap but no containment), you get an overlap
error. Specialization is consulted when selecting an impl (of course),
and the graph is consulted when propagating defaults down the
specialization hierarchy.</p>
<p>You might expect that the specialization graph would be used during
selection – i.e. when actually performing specialization. This is
not done for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It's merely an optimization: given a set of candidates that apply,
we can determine the most specialized one by comparing them directly
for specialization, rather than consulting the graph. Given that we
also cache the results of selection, the benefit of this
optimization is questionable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To build the specialization graph in the first place, we need to use
selection (because we need to determine whether one impl specializes
another). Dealing with this reentrancy would require some additional
mode switch for selection. Given that there seems to be no strong
reason to use the graph anyway, we stick with a simpler approach in
selection, and use the graph only for propagating default
implementations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Trait impl selection can succeed even when multiple impls can apply,
as long as they are part of the same specialization family. In that
case, it returns a <em>single</em> impl on success – this is the most
specialized impl <em>known</em> to apply. However, if there are any inference
variables in play, the returned impl may not be the actual impl we
will use at codegen time. Thus, we take special care to avoid projecting
associated types unless either (1) the associated type does not use
<code>default</code> and thus cannot be overridden or (2) all input types are
known concretely.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/chalk">Chalk</a> is an experimental trait solver for Rust that is
(as of <!-- date-check --> May 2022) under development by the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/types-team">Types team</a>.
Its goal is to enable a lot of trait system features and bug fixes
that are hard to implement (e.g. GATs or specialization). If you would like to
help in hacking on the new solver, drop by on the rust-lang Zulip in the <a href="https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/144729-t-types"><code>#t-types</code></a>
stream and say hello!</p>
<p>The new-style trait solver is based on the work done in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/chalk">chalk</a>. Chalk
recasts Rust's trait system explicitly in terms of logic programming. It does
this by &quot;lowering&quot; Rust code into a kind of logic program we can then execute
queries against.</p>
<p>The key observation here is that the Rust trait system is basically a
kind of logic, and it can be mapped onto standard logical inference
rules. We can then look for solutions to those inference rules in a
very similar fashion to how e.g. a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog">Prolog</a> solver works. It turns out
that we can't <em>quite</em> use Prolog rules (also called Horn clauses) but
rather need a somewhat more expressive variant.</p>
<p>You can read more about chalk itself in the
<a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/chalk/book/">Chalk book</a> section.</p>
<h2 id="ongoing-work"><a class="header" href="#ongoing-work">Ongoing work</a></h2>
<p>The design of the new-style trait solving happens in two places:</p>
<p><strong>chalk</strong>. The <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/chalk">chalk</a> repository is where we experiment with new ideas
and designs for the trait system.</p>
<p><strong>rustc</strong>. Once we are happy with the logical rules, we proceed to
implementing them in rustc. We map our struct, trait, and impl declarations
into logical inference rules in the lowering module in rustc.</p>

<p>The key observation here is that the Rust trait system is basically a
kind of logic, and it can be mapped onto standard logical inference
rules. We can then look for solutions to those inference rules in a
very similar fashion to how e.g. a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog">Prolog</a> solver works. It turns out
that we can't <em>quite</em> use Prolog rules (also called Horn clauses) but
rather need a somewhat more expressive variant.</p>
<h2 id="rust-traits-and-logic"><a class="header" href="#rust-traits-and-logic">Rust traits and logic</a></h2>
<p>One of the first observations is that the Rust trait system is
basically a kind of logic. As such, we can map our struct, trait, and
impl declarations into logical inference rules. For the most part,
these are basically Horn clauses, though we'll see that to capture the
full richness of Rust – and in particular to support generic
programming – we have to go a bit further than standard Horn clauses.</p>
<p>To see how this mapping works, let's start with an example. Imagine
we declare a trait and a few impls, like so:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>trait Clone { }
impl Clone for usize { }
impl&lt;T&gt; Clone for Vec&lt;T&gt; where T: Clone { }
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>We could map these declarations to some Horn clauses, written in a
Prolog-like notation, as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Clone(usize).
Clone(Vec&lt;?T&gt;) :- Clone(?T).

// The notation `A :- B` means &quot;A is true if B is true&quot;.
// Or, put another way, B implies A.
</code></pre>
<p>In Prolog terms, we might say that <code>Clone(Foo)</code> – where <code>Foo</code> is some
Rust type – is a <em>predicate</em> that represents the idea that the type
<code>Foo</code> implements <code>Clone</code>. These rules are <strong>program clauses</strong>; they
state the conditions under which that predicate can be proven (i.e.,
considered true). So the first rule just says &quot;Clone is implemented
for <code>usize</code>&quot;. The next rule says &quot;for any type <code>?T</code>, Clone is
implemented for <code>Vec&lt;?T&gt;</code> if clone is implemented for <code>?T</code>&quot;. So
e.g. if we wanted to prove that <code>Clone(Vec&lt;Vec&lt;usize&gt;&gt;)</code>, we would do
so by applying the rules recursively:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Clone(Vec&lt;Vec&lt;usize&gt;&gt;)</code> is provable if:
<ul>
<li><code>Clone(Vec&lt;usize&gt;)</code> is provable if:
<ul>
<li><code>Clone(usize)</code> is provable. (Which it is, so we're all good.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But now suppose we tried to prove that <code>Clone(Vec&lt;Bar&gt;)</code>. This would
fail (after all, I didn't give an impl of <code>Clone</code> for <code>Bar</code>):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Clone(Vec&lt;Bar&gt;)</code> is provable if:
<ul>
<li><code>Clone(Bar)</code> is provable. (But it is not, as there are no applicable rules.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We can easily extend the example above to cover generic traits with
more than one input type. So imagine the <code>Eq&lt;T&gt;</code> trait, which declares
that <code>Self</code> is equatable with a value of type <code>T</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">trait Eq&lt;T&gt; { ... }
impl Eq&lt;usize&gt; for usize { }
impl&lt;T: Eq&lt;U&gt;&gt; Eq&lt;Vec&lt;U&gt;&gt; for Vec&lt;T&gt; { }
</code></pre>
<p>That could be mapped as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Eq(usize, usize).
Eq(Vec&lt;?T&gt;, Vec&lt;?U&gt;) :- Eq(?T, ?U).
</code></pre>
<p>So far so good.</p>
<h2 id="type-checking-normal-functions"><a class="header" href="#type-checking-normal-functions">Type-checking normal functions</a></h2>
<p>OK, now that we have defined some logical rules that are able to
express when traits are implemented and to handle associated types,
let's turn our focus a bit towards <strong>type-checking</strong>. Type-checking is
interesting because it is what gives us the goals that we need to
prove. That is, everything we've seen so far has been about how we
derive the rules by which we can prove goals from the traits and impls
in the program; but we are also interested in how to derive the goals
that we need to prove, and those come from type-checking.</p>
<p>Consider type-checking the function <code>foo()</code> here:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn foo() { bar::&lt;usize&gt;() }
fn bar&lt;U: Eq&lt;U&gt;&gt;() { }
</code></pre>
<p>This function is very simple, of course: all it does is to call
<code>bar::&lt;usize&gt;()</code>. Now, looking at the definition of <code>bar()</code>, we can see
that it has one where-clause <code>U: Eq&lt;U&gt;</code>. So, that means that <code>foo()</code> will
have to prove that <code>usize: Eq&lt;usize&gt;</code> in order to show that it can call <code>bar()</code>
with <code>usize</code> as the type argument.</p>
<p>If we wanted, we could write a Prolog predicate that defines the
conditions under which <code>bar()</code> can be called. We'll say that those
conditions are called being &quot;well-formed&quot;:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">barWellFormed(?U) :- Eq(?U, ?U).
</code></pre>
<p>Then we can say that <code>foo()</code> type-checks if the reference to
<code>bar::&lt;usize&gt;</code> (that is, <code>bar()</code> applied to the type <code>usize</code>) is
well-formed:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">fooTypeChecks :- barWellFormed(usize).
</code></pre>
<p>If we try to prove the goal <code>fooTypeChecks</code>, it will succeed:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>fooTypeChecks</code> is provable if:
<ul>
<li><code>barWellFormed(usize)</code>, which is provable if:
<ul>
<li><code>Eq(usize, usize)</code>, which is provable because of an impl.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Ok, so far so good. Let's move on to type-checking a more complex function.</p>
<h2 id="type-checking-generic-functions-beyond-horn-clauses"><a class="header" href="#type-checking-generic-functions-beyond-horn-clauses">Type-checking generic functions: beyond Horn clauses</a></h2>
<p>In the last section, we used standard Prolog horn-clauses (augmented with Rust's
notion of type equality) to type-check some simple Rust functions. But that only
works when we are type-checking non-generic functions. If we want to type-check
a generic function, it turns out we need a stronger notion of goal than what Prolog
can provide. To see what I'm talking about, let's revamp our previous
example to make <code>foo</code> generic:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn foo&lt;T: Eq&lt;T&gt;&gt;() { bar::&lt;T&gt;() }
fn bar&lt;U: Eq&lt;U&gt;&gt;() { }
</code></pre>
<p>To type-check the body of <code>foo</code>, we need to be able to hold the type
<code>T</code> &quot;abstract&quot;.  That is, we need to check that the body of <code>foo</code> is
type-safe <em>for all types <code>T</code></em>, not just for some specific type. We might express
this like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">fooTypeChecks :-
  // for all types T...
  forall&lt;T&gt; {
    // ...if we assume that Eq(T, T) is provable...
    if (Eq(T, T)) {
      // ...then we can prove that `barWellFormed(T)` holds.
      barWellFormed(T)
    }
  }.
</code></pre>
<p>This notation I'm using here is the notation I've been using in my
prototype implementation; it's similar to standard mathematical
notation but a bit Rustified. Anyway, the problem is that standard
Horn clauses don't allow universal quantification (<code>forall</code>) or
implication (<code>if</code>) in goals (though many Prolog engines do support
them, as an extension). For this reason, we need to accept something
called &quot;first-order hereditary harrop&quot; (FOHH) clauses – this long
name basically means &quot;standard Horn clauses with <code>forall</code> and <code>if</code> in
the body&quot;. But it's nice to know the proper name, because there is a
lot of work describing how to efficiently handle FOHH clauses; see for
example Gopalan Nadathur's excellent
<a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/chalk/book/bibliography.html#pphhf">&quot;A Proof Procedure for the Logic of Hereditary Harrop Formulas&quot;</a>
in <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/chalk/book/bibliography.html">the bibliography of Chalk Book</a>.</p>
<p>It turns out that supporting FOHH is not really all that hard. And
once we are able to do that, we can easily describe the type-checking
rule for generic functions like <code>foo</code> in our logic.</p>

<p>In logic programming terms, a <strong>goal</strong> is something that you must
prove and a <strong>clause</strong> is something that you know is true. As
described in the <a href="traits/./lowering-to-logic.html">lowering to logic</a>
chapter, Rust's trait solver is based on an extension of hereditary
harrop (HH) clauses, which extend traditional Prolog Horn clauses with
a few new superpowers.</p>
<h2 id="goals-and-clauses-meta-structure"><a class="header" href="#goals-and-clauses-meta-structure">Goals and clauses meta structure</a></h2>
<p>In Rust's solver, <strong>goals</strong> and <strong>clauses</strong> have the following forms
(note that the two definitions reference one another):</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Goal = DomainGoal           // defined in the section below
        | Goal &amp;&amp; Goal
        | Goal || Goal
        | exists&lt;K&gt; { Goal }   // existential quantification
        | forall&lt;K&gt; { Goal }   // universal quantification
        | if (Clause) { Goal } // implication
        | true                 // something that's trivially true
        | ambiguous            // something that's never provable

Clause = DomainGoal
        | Clause :- Goal     // if can prove Goal, then Clause is true
        | Clause &amp;&amp; Clause
        | forall&lt;K&gt; { Clause }

K = &lt;type&gt;     // a &quot;kind&quot;
    | &lt;lifetime&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The proof procedure for these sorts of goals is actually quite
straightforward.  Essentially, it's a form of depth-first search. The
paper
<a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/chalk/book/bibliography.html#pphhf">&quot;A Proof Procedure for the Logic of Hereditary Harrop Formulas&quot;</a>
gives the details.</p>
<p>In terms of code, these types are defined in
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/compiler/rustc_middle/src/traits/mod.rs"><code>rustc_middle/src/traits/mod.rs</code></a> in rustc, and in
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/chalk/blob/master/chalk-ir/src/lib.rs"><code>chalk-ir/src/lib.rs</code></a> in chalk.</p>
<p><a name="domain-goals"></a></p>
<h2 id="domain-goals"><a class="header" href="#domain-goals">Domain goals</a></h2>
<p><em>Domain goals</em> are the atoms of the trait logic. As can be seen in the
definitions given above, general goals basically consist in a combination of
domain goals.</p>
<p>Moreover, flattening a bit the definition of clauses given previously, one can
see that clauses are always of the form:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">forall&lt;K1, ..., Kn&gt; { DomainGoal :- Goal }
</code></pre>
<p>hence domain goals are in fact clauses' LHS. That is, at the most granular level,
domain goals are what the trait solver will end up trying to prove.</p>
<p><a name="trait-ref"></a></p>
<p>To define the set of domain goals in our system, we need to first
introduce a few simple formulations. A <strong>trait reference</strong> consists of
the name of a trait along with a suitable set of inputs P0..Pn:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">TraitRef = P0: TraitName&lt;P1..Pn&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>So, for example, <code>u32: Display</code> is a trait reference, as is <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;: IntoIterator</code>. Note that Rust surface syntax also permits some extra
things, like associated type bindings (<code>Vec&lt;T&gt;: IntoIterator&lt;Item = T&gt;</code>), that are not part of a trait reference.</p>
<p><a name="projection"></a></p>
<p>A <strong>projection</strong> consists of an associated item reference along with
its inputs P0..Pm:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Projection = &lt;P0 as TraitName&lt;P1..Pn&gt;&gt;::AssocItem&lt;Pn+1..Pm&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Given these, we can define a <code>DomainGoal</code> as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">DomainGoal = Holds(WhereClause)
            | FromEnv(TraitRef)
            | FromEnv(Type)
            | WellFormed(TraitRef)
            | WellFormed(Type)
            | Normalize(Projection -&gt; Type)

WhereClause = Implemented(TraitRef)
            | ProjectionEq(Projection = Type)
            | Outlives(Type: Region)
            | Outlives(Region: Region)
</code></pre>
<p><code>WhereClause</code> refers to a <code>where</code> clause that a Rust user would actually be able
to write in a Rust program. This abstraction exists only as a convenience as we
sometimes want to only deal with domain goals that are effectively writable in
Rust.</p>
<p>Let's break down each one of these, one-by-one.</p>
<h4 id="implementedtraitref"><a class="header" href="#implementedtraitref">Implemented(TraitRef)</a></h4>
<p>e.g. <code>Implemented(i32: Copy)</code></p>
<p>True if the given trait is implemented for the given input types and lifetimes.</p>
<h4 id="projectioneqprojection--type"><a class="header" href="#projectioneqprojection--type">ProjectionEq(Projection = Type)</a></h4>
<p>e.g. <code>ProjectionEq&lt;T as Iterator&gt;::Item = u8</code></p>
<p>The given associated type <code>Projection</code> is equal to <code>Type</code>; this can be proved
with either normalization or using placeholder associated types. See

<h4 id="normalizeprojection---type"><a class="header" href="#normalizeprojection---type">Normalize(Projection -&gt; Type)</a></h4>
<p>e.g. <code>ProjectionEq&lt;T as Iterator&gt;::Item -&gt; u8</code></p>
<p>The given associated type <code>Projection</code> can be <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/chalk/book/clauses/type_equality.html#normalize">normalized</a> to <code>Type</code>.</p>
<p>As discussed in <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/chalk/book/clauses/type_equality.html">the section on associated
types in Chalk Book</a>, <code>Normalize</code> implies <code>ProjectionEq</code>,
but not vice versa. In general, proving <code>Normalize(&lt;T as Trait&gt;::Item -&gt; U)</code>
also requires proving <code>Implemented(T: Trait)</code>.</p>
<h4 id="fromenvtraitref"><a class="header" href="#fromenvtraitref">FromEnv(TraitRef)</a></h4>
<p>e.g. <code>FromEnv(Self: Add&lt;i32&gt;)</code></p>
<p>True if the inner <code>TraitRef</code> is <em>assumed</em> to be true,
that is, if it can be derived from the in-scope where clauses.</p>
<p>For example, given the following function:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>fn loud_clone&lt;T: Clone&gt;(stuff: &amp;T) -&gt; T {
    println!(&quot;cloning!&quot;);
    stuff.clone()
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Inside the body of our function, we would have <code>FromEnv(T: Clone)</code>. In-scope
where clauses nest, so a function body inside an impl body inherits the
impl body's where clauses, too.</p>
<p>This and the next rule are used to implement <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/chalk/book/clauses/implied_bounds.html#implied-bounds">implied bounds</a>. As we'll see
in the section on lowering, <code>FromEnv(TraitRef)</code> implies <code>Implemented(TraitRef)</code>,
but not vice versa. This distinction is crucial to implied bounds.</p>
<h4 id="fromenvtype"><a class="header" href="#fromenvtype">FromEnv(Type)</a></h4>
<p>e.g. <code>FromEnv(HashSet&lt;K&gt;)</code></p>
<p>True if the inner <code>Type</code> is <em>assumed</em> to be well-formed, that is, if it is an
input type of a function or an impl.</p>
<p>For example, given the following code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">struct HashSet&lt;K&gt; where K: Hash { ... }

fn loud_insert&lt;K&gt;(set: &amp;mut HashSet&lt;K&gt;, item: K) {
    println!(&quot;inserting!&quot;);
    set.insert(item);
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>HashSet&lt;K&gt;</code> is an input type of the <code>loud_insert</code> function. Hence, we assume it
to be well-formed, so we would have <code>FromEnv(HashSet&lt;K&gt;)</code> inside the body of our
function. As we'll see in the section on lowering, <code>FromEnv(HashSet&lt;K&gt;)</code> implies
<code>Implemented(K: Hash)</code> because the
<code>HashSet</code> declaration was written with a <code>K: Hash</code> where clause. Hence, we don't
need to repeat that bound on the <code>loud_insert</code> function: we rather automatically
assume that it is true.</p>
<h4 id="wellformeditem"><a class="header" href="#wellformeditem">WellFormed(Item)</a></h4>
<p>These goals imply that the given item is <em>well-formed</em>.</p>
<p>We can talk about different types of items being well-formed:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Types</em>, like <code>WellFormed(Vec&lt;i32&gt;)</code>, which is true in Rust, or
<code>WellFormed(Vec&lt;str&gt;)</code>, which is not (because <code>str</code> is not <code>Sized</code>.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>TraitRefs</em>, like <code>WellFormed(Vec&lt;i32&gt;: Clone)</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Well-formedness is important to <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/chalk/book/clauses/implied_bounds.html#implied-bounds">implied bounds</a>. In particular, the reason
it is okay to assume <code>FromEnv(T: Clone)</code> in the <code>loud_clone</code> example is that we
<em>also</em> verify <code>WellFormed(T: Clone)</code> for each call site of <code>loud_clone</code>.
Similarly, it is okay to assume <code>FromEnv(HashSet&lt;K&gt;)</code> in the <code>loud_insert</code>
example because we will verify <code>WellFormed(HashSet&lt;K&gt;)</code> for each call site of
<code>loud_insert</code>.</p>
<h4 id="outlivestype-region-outlivesregion-region"><a class="header" href="#outlivestype-region-outlivesregion-region">Outlives(Type: Region), Outlives(Region: Region)</a></h4>
<p>e.g. <code>Outlives(&amp;'a str: 'b)</code>, <code>Outlives('a: 'static)</code></p>
<p>True if the given type or region on the left outlives the right-hand region.</p>
<p><a name="coinductive"></a></p>
<h2 id="coinductive-goals"><a class="header" href="#coinductive-goals">Coinductive goals</a></h2>
<p>Most goals in our system are &quot;inductive&quot;. In an inductive goal,
circular reasoning is disallowed. Consider this example clause:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">    Implemented(Foo: Bar) :-
        Implemented(Foo: Bar).
</code></pre>
<p>Considered inductively, this clause is useless: if we are trying to
prove <code>Implemented(Foo: Bar)</code>, we would then recursively have to prove
<code>Implemented(Foo: Bar)</code>, and that cycle would continue ad infinitum
(the trait solver will terminate here, it would just consider that
<code>Implemented(Foo: Bar)</code> is not known to be true).</p>
<p>However, some goals are <em>co-inductive</em>. Simply put, this means that
cycles are OK. So, if <code>Bar</code> were a co-inductive trait, then the rule
above would be perfectly valid, and it would indicate that
<code>Implemented(Foo: Bar)</code> is true.</p>
<p><em>Auto traits</em> are one example in Rust where co-inductive goals are used.
Consider the <code>Send</code> trait, and imagine that we have this struct:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>struct Foo {
    next: Option&lt;Box&lt;Foo&gt;&gt;
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>The default rules for auto traits say that <code>Foo</code> is <code>Send</code> if the
types of its fields are <code>Send</code>. Therefore, we would have a rule like</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Implemented(Foo: Send) :-
    Implemented(Option&lt;Box&lt;Foo&gt;&gt;: Send).
</code></pre>
<p>As you can probably imagine, proving that <code>Option&lt;Box&lt;Foo&gt;&gt;: Send</code> is
going to wind up circularly requiring us to prove that <code>Foo: Send</code>
again. So this would be an example where we wind up in a cycle – but
that's ok, we <em>do</em> consider <code>Foo: Send</code> to hold, even though it
references itself.</p>
<p>In general, co-inductive traits are used in Rust trait solving when we
want to enumerate a fixed set of possibilities. In the case of auto
traits, we are enumerating the set of reachable types from a given
starting point (i.e., <code>Foo</code> can reach values of type
<code>Option&lt;Box&lt;Foo&gt;&gt;</code>, which implies it can reach values of type
<code>Box&lt;Foo&gt;</code>, and then of type <code>Foo</code>, and then the cycle is complete).</p>
<p>In addition to auto traits, <code>WellFormed</code> predicates are co-inductive.
These are used to achieve a similar &quot;enumerate all the cases&quot; pattern,
as described in the section on <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/chalk/book/clauses/implied_bounds.html#implied-bounds">implied bounds</a>.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="canonical-queries"><a class="header" href="#canonical-queries">Canonical queries</a></h1>
<p>The &quot;start&quot; of the trait system is the <strong>canonical query</strong> (these are
both queries in the more general sense of the word – something you
would like to know the answer to – and in the
<a href="traits/../query.html">rustc-specific sense</a>).  The idea is that the type
checker or other parts of the system, may in the course of doing their
thing want to know whether some trait is implemented for some type
(e.g., is <code>u32: Debug</code> true?). Or they may want to
normalize some associated type.</p>
<p>This section covers queries at a fairly high level of abstraction. The
subsections look a bit more closely at how these ideas are implemented
in rustc.</p>
<h2 id="the-traditional-interactive-prolog-query"><a class="header" href="#the-traditional-interactive-prolog-query">The traditional, interactive Prolog query</a></h2>
<p>In a traditional Prolog system, when you start a query, the solver
will run off and start supplying you with every possible answer it can
find. So given something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">?- Vec&lt;i32&gt;: AsRef&lt;?U&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The solver might answer:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Vec&lt;i32&gt;: AsRef&lt;[i32]&gt;
    continue? (y/n)
</code></pre>
<p>This <code>continue</code> bit is interesting. The idea in Prolog is that the
solver is finding <strong>all possible</strong> instantiations of your query that
are true. In this case, if we instantiate <code>?U = [i32]</code>, then the query
is true (note that a traditional Prolog interface does not, directly,
tell us a value for <code>?U</code>, but we can infer one by unifying the
response with our original query – Rust's solver gives back a
substitution instead). If we were to hit <code>y</code>, the solver might then
give us another possible answer:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Vec&lt;i32&gt;: AsRef&lt;Vec&lt;i32&gt;&gt;
    continue? (y/n)
</code></pre>
<p>This answer derives from the fact that there is a reflexive impl
(<code>impl&lt;T&gt; AsRef&lt;T&gt; for T</code>) for <code>AsRef</code>. If were to hit <code>y</code> again,
then we might get back a negative response:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">no
</code></pre>
<p>Naturally, in some cases, there may be no possible answers, and hence
the solver will just give me back <code>no</code> right away:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">?- Box&lt;i32&gt;: Copy
    no
</code></pre>
<p>In some cases, there might be an infinite number of responses. So for
example if I gave this query, and I kept hitting <code>y</code>, then the solver
would never stop giving me back answers:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">?- Vec&lt;?U&gt;: Clone
    Vec&lt;i32&gt;: Clone
        continue? (y/n)
    Vec&lt;Box&lt;i32&gt;&gt;: Clone
        continue? (y/n)
    Vec&lt;Box&lt;Box&lt;i32&gt;&gt;&gt;: Clone
        continue? (y/n)
    Vec&lt;Box&lt;Box&lt;Box&lt;i32&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;: Clone
        continue? (y/n)
</code></pre>
<p>As you can imagine, the solver will gleefully keep adding another
layer of <code>Box</code> until we ask it to stop, or it runs out of memory.</p>
<p>Another interesting thing is that queries might still have variables
in them. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">?- Rc&lt;?T&gt;: Clone
</code></pre>
<p>might produce the answer:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Rc&lt;?T&gt;: Clone
    continue? (y/n)
</code></pre>
<p>After all, <code>Rc&lt;?T&gt;</code> is true <strong>no matter what type <code>?T</code> is</strong>.</p>
<p><a name="query-response"></a></p>
<h2 id="a-trait-query-in-rustc"><a class="header" href="#a-trait-query-in-rustc">A trait query in rustc</a></h2>
<p>The trait queries in rustc work somewhat differently. Instead of
trying to enumerate <strong>all possible</strong> answers for you, they are looking
for an <strong>unambiguous</strong> answer. In particular, when they tell you the
value for a type variable, that means that this is the <strong>only possible
instantiation</strong> that you could use, given the current set of impls and
where-clauses, that would be provable.</p>
<p>The response to a trait query in rustc is typically a
<code>Result&lt;QueryResult&lt;T&gt;, NoSolution&gt;</code> (where the <code>T</code> will vary a bit
depending on the query itself). The <code>Err(NoSolution)</code> case indicates
that the query was false and had no answers (e.g., <code>Box&lt;i32&gt;: Copy</code>).
Otherwise, the <code>QueryResult</code> gives back information about the possible answer(s)
we did find. It consists of four parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Certainty:</strong> tells you how sure we are of this answer. It can have two
values:
<ul>
<li><code>Proven</code> means that the result is known to be true.
<ul>
<li>This might be the result for trying to prove <code>Vec&lt;i32&gt;: Clone</code>,
say, or <code>Rc&lt;?T&gt;: Clone</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>Ambiguous</code> means that there were things we could not yet prove to
be either true <em>or</em> false, typically because more type information
was needed. (We'll see an example shortly.)
<ul>
<li>This might be the result for trying to prove <code>Vec&lt;?T&gt;: Clone</code>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Var values:</strong> Values for each of the unbound inference variables
(like <code>?T</code>) that appeared in your original query. (Remember that in Prolog,
we had to infer these.)
<ul>
<li>As we'll see in the example below, we can get back var values even
for <code>Ambiguous</code> cases.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Region constraints:</strong> these are relations that must hold between
the lifetimes that you supplied as inputs. We'll ignore these here.</li>
<li><strong>Value:</strong> The query result also comes with a value of type <code>T</code>. For
some specialized queries – like normalizing associated types –
this is used to carry back an extra result, but it's often just
<code>()</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="examples-1"><a class="header" href="#examples-1">Examples</a></h3>
<p>Let's work through an example query to see what all the parts mean.
Consider <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/borrow/trait.Borrow.html">the <code>Borrow</code> trait</a>. This trait has a number of
impls; among them, there are these two (for clarity, I've written the
<code>Sized</code> bounds explicitly):</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">impl&lt;T&gt; Borrow&lt;T&gt; for T where T: ?Sized
impl&lt;T&gt; Borrow&lt;[T]&gt; for Vec&lt;T&gt; where T: Sized
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example 1.</strong> Imagine we are type-checking this (rather artificial)
bit of code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn foo&lt;A, B&gt;(a: A, vec_b: Option&lt;B&gt;) where A: Borrow&lt;B&gt; { }

fn main() {
    let mut t: Vec&lt;_&gt; = vec![]; // Type: Vec&lt;?T&gt;
    let mut u: Option&lt;_&gt; = None; // Type: Option&lt;?U&gt;
    foo(t, u); // Example 1: requires `Vec&lt;?T&gt;: Borrow&lt;?U&gt;`
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>As the comments indicate, we first create two variables <code>t</code> and <code>u</code>;
<code>t</code> is an empty vector and <code>u</code> is a <code>None</code> option. Both of these
variables have unbound inference variables in their type: <code>?T</code>
represents the elements in the vector <code>t</code> and <code>?U</code> represents the
value stored in the option <code>u</code>.  Next, we invoke <code>foo</code>; comparing the
signature of <code>foo</code> to its arguments, we wind up with <code>A = Vec&lt;?T&gt;</code> and
<code>B = ?U</code>. Therefore, the where clause on <code>foo</code> requires that <code>Vec&lt;?T&gt;: Borrow&lt;?U&gt;</code>. This is thus our first example trait query.</p>
<p>There are many possible solutions to the query <code>Vec&lt;?T&gt;: Borrow&lt;?U&gt;</code>;
for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>?U = Vec&lt;?T&gt;</code>,</li>
<li><code>?U = [?T]</code>,</li>
<li><code>?T = u32, ?U = [u32]</code></li>
<li>and so forth.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, the result we get back would be as follows (I'm going to
ignore region constraints and the &quot;value&quot;):</p>
<ul>
<li>Certainty: <code>Ambiguous</code> – we're not sure yet if this holds</li>
<li>Var values: <code>[?T = ?T, ?U = ?U]</code> – we learned nothing about the values of
the variables</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, the query result says that it is too soon to say much about
whether this trait is proven. During type-checking, this is not an
immediate error: instead, the type checker would hold on to this
requirement (<code>Vec&lt;?T&gt;: Borrow&lt;?U&gt;</code>) and wait. As we'll see in the next
example, it may happen that <code>?T</code> and <code>?U</code> wind up constrained from
other sources, in which case we can try the trait query again.</p>
<p><strong>Example 2.</strong> We can now extend our previous example a bit,
and assign a value to <code>u</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn foo&lt;A, B&gt;(a: A, vec_b: Option&lt;B&gt;) where A: Borrow&lt;B&gt; { }

fn main() {
    // What we saw before:
    let mut t: Vec&lt;_&gt; = vec![]; // Type: Vec&lt;?T&gt;
    let mut u: Option&lt;_&gt; = None; // Type: Option&lt;?U&gt;
    foo(t, u); // `Vec&lt;?T&gt;: Borrow&lt;?U&gt;` =&gt; ambiguous

    // New stuff:
    u = Some(vec![]); // ?U = Vec&lt;?V&gt;
}
</code></pre>
<p>As a result of this assignment, the type of <code>u</code> is forced to be
<code>Option&lt;Vec&lt;?V&gt;&gt;</code>, where <code>?V</code> represents the element type of the
vector. This in turn implies that <code>?U</code> is <a href="traits/../type-checking.html">unified</a> to <code>Vec&lt;?V&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Let's suppose that the type checker decides to revisit the
&quot;as-yet-unproven&quot; trait obligation we saw before, <code>Vec&lt;?T&gt;: Borrow&lt;?U&gt;</code>. <code>?U</code> is no longer an unbound inference variable; it now
has a value, <code>Vec&lt;?V&gt;</code>. So, if we &quot;refresh&quot; the query with that value, we get:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Vec&lt;?T&gt;: Borrow&lt;Vec&lt;?V&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This time, there is only one impl that applies, the reflexive impl:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">impl&lt;T&gt; Borrow&lt;T&gt; for T where T: ?Sized
</code></pre>
<p>Therefore, the trait checker will answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Certainty: <code>Proven</code></li>
<li>Var values: <code>[?T = ?T, ?V = ?T]</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Here, it is saying that we have indeed proven that the obligation
holds, and we also know that <code>?T</code> and <code>?V</code> are the same type (but we
don't know what that type is yet!).</p>
<p>(In fact, as the function ends here, the type checker would give an
error at this point, since the element types of <code>t</code> and <code>u</code> are still
not yet known, even though they are known to be the same.)</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="trait-solving-new"><a class="header" href="#trait-solving-new">Trait solving (new)</a></h1>
<p>This chapter describes how trait solving works with the new WIP solver located in
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_trait_selection/solve/index.html"><code>rustc_trait_selection/solve</code></a>. Feel free to also look at the docs for
<a href="solve/../traits/resolution.hmtl">the current solver</a> and <a href="solve/./chalk.html">the chalk solver</a>
can be found separately.</p>
<h2 id="core-concepts"><a class="header" href="#core-concepts">Core concepts</a></h2>
<p>The goal of the trait system is to check whether a given trait bound is satisfied.
Most notably when typechecking the body of - potentially generic - functions.
For example:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>fn uses_vec_clone&lt;T: Clone&gt;(x: Vec&lt;T&gt;) -&gt; (Vec&lt;T&gt;, Vec&lt;T&gt;) {
    (x.clone(), x)
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Here the call to <code>x.clone()</code> requires us to prove that <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> implements <code>Clone</code> given
the assumption that <code>T: Clone</code> is true. We can assume <code>T: Clone</code> as that will be proven by
callers of this function.</p>
<p>The concept of &quot;prove the <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;: Clone</code> with the assumption <code>T: Clone</code>&quot; is called a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_trait_selection/solve/struct.Goal.html"><code>Goal</code></a>.
Both <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;: Clone</code> and <code>T: Clone</code> are represented using <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/struct.Predicate.html"><code>Predicate</code></a>. There are other
predicates, most notably equality bounds on associated items: <code>&lt;Vec&lt;T&gt; as IntoIterator&gt;::Item == T</code>.
See the <code>PredicateKind</code> enum for an exhaustive list. A <code>Goal</code> is represented as the <code>predicate</code> we
have to prove and the <code>param_env</code> in which this predicate has to hold.</p>
<p>We prove goals by checking whether each possible <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_trait_selection/solve/assembly/struct.Candidate.html"><code>Candidate</code></a> applies for the given goal by
recursively proving its nested goals. For a list of possible candidates with examples, look at
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_trait_selection/solve/trait_goals/enum.CandidateSource.html"><code>CandidateSource</code></a>. The most important candidates are <code>Impl</code> candidates, i.e. trait implementations
written by the user,  and <code>ParamEnv</code> candidates, i.e. assumptions in our current environment.</p>
<p>Looking at the above example, to prove <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;: Clone</code> we first use
<code>impl&lt;T: Clone&gt; Clone for Vec&lt;T&gt;</code>. To use this impl we have to prove the nested
goal that <code>T: Clone</code> holds. This can use the assumption <code>T: Clone</code> from the <code>ParamEnv</code>
which does not have any nested goals. Therefore <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;: Clone</code> holds.</p>
<p>The trait solver can either return success, ambiguity or an error as a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_trait_selection/solve/type.CanonicalResponse.html"><code>CanonicalResponse</code></a>.
For success and ambiguity it also returns constraints inference and region constraints.</p>
<h2 id="requirements"><a class="header" href="#requirements">Requirements</a></h2>
<p>Before we dive into the new solver lets first take the time to go through all of our requirements
on the trait system. We can then use these to guide our design later on.</p>
<p>TODO: elaborate on these rules and get more precise about their meaning.
Also add issues where each of these rules have been broken in the past
(or still are).</p>
<h3 id="1-the-trait-solver-has-to-be-sound"><a class="header" href="#1-the-trait-solver-has-to-be-sound">1. The trait solver has to be <em>sound</em></a></h3>
<p>This means that we must never return <em>success</em> for goals for which no <code>impl</code> exists. That would
simply be unsound by assuming a trait is implemented even though it is not. When using predicates
from the <code>where</code>-bounds, the <code>impl</code> will be proved by the user of the item.</p>
<h3 id="2-if-type-checker-solves-generic-goal-concrete-instantiations-of-that-goal-have-the-same-result"><a class="header" href="#2-if-type-checker-solves-generic-goal-concrete-instantiations-of-that-goal-have-the-same-result">2. If type checker solves generic goal concrete instantiations of that goal have the same result</a></h3>
<p>Pretty much: If we successfully typecheck a generic function concrete instantiations
of that function should also typeck. We should not get errors post-monomorphization.
We can however get overflow as in the following snippet:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>fn foo&lt;T: Trait&gt;(x: )

<p>If a trait goal holds with an empty environment, there is a unique <code>impl</code>,
either user-defined or builtin, which is used to prove that goal.</p>
<p>This is necessary for codegen to select a unique method.
An exception here are <em>marker traits</em> which are allowed to overlap.</p>

<p>Normalization for alias types/consts has a unique result. Otherwise we can easily implement
transmute in safe code. Given the following function, we have to make sure that the input and
output types always get normalized to the same concrete type.</p>

<p>The trait solver may use coinduction when proving goals.
Coinduction is fairly subtle so we're giving it its own chapter.</p>
<h2 id="coinduction-and-induction"><a class="header" href="#coinduction-and-induction">Coinduction and induction</a></h2>
<p>With induction, we recursively apply proofs until we end up with a finite proof tree.
Consider the example of <code>Vec&lt;Vec&lt;Vec&lt;u32&gt;&gt;&gt;: Debug</code> which results in the following tree.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Vec&lt;Vec&lt;Vec&lt;u32&gt;&gt;&gt;: Debug</code>
<ul>
<li><code>Vec&lt;Vec&lt;u32&gt;&gt;: Debug</code>
<ul>
<li><code>Vec&lt;u32&gt;: Debug</code>
<ul>
<li><code>u32: Debug</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This tree is finite. But not all goals we would want to hold have finite proof trees,
consider the following example:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>struct List&lt;T&gt; {
    value: T,
    next: Option&lt;Box&lt;List&lt;T&gt;&gt;&gt;,
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>For <code>List&lt;T&gt;: Send</code> to hold all its fields have to recursively implement <code>Send</code> as well.
This would result in the following proof tree:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>List&lt;T&gt;: Send</code>
<ul>
<li><code>T: Send</code></li>
<li><code>Option&lt;Box&lt;List&lt;T&gt;&gt;&gt;: Send</code>
<ul>
<li><code>Box&lt;List&lt;T&gt;&gt;: Send</code>
<ul>
<li><code>List&lt;T&gt;: Send</code>
<ul>
<li><code>T: Send</code></li>
<li><code>Option&lt;Box&lt;List&lt;T&gt;&gt;&gt;: Send</code>
<ul>
<li><code>Box&lt;List&lt;T&gt;&gt;: Send</code>
<ul>
<li>...</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This tree would be infinitely large which is exactly what coinduction is about. </p>

<p>To <strong>inductively</strong> prove a goal you need to provide a finite proof tree for it.
To <strong>coinductively</strong> prove a goal the provided proof tree may be infinite.</p>

<h2 id="why-is-coinduction-correct"><a class="header" href="#why-is-coinduction-correct">Why is coinduction correct</a></h2>
<p>When checking whether some trait goals holds, we're asking &quot;does there exist an <code>impl</code>
which satisfies this bound&quot;. Even if are infinite chains of nested goals, we still have a
unique <code>impl</code> which should be used.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-implement-coinduction"><a class="header" href="#how-to-implement-coinduction">How to implement coinduction</a></h2>
<p>While our implementation can not check for coinduction by trying to construct an infinite
tree as that would take infinite resources, it still makes sense to think of coinduction
from this perspective.</p>
<p>As we cannot check for infinite trees, we instead search for patterns for which we know that
they would result in an infinite proof tree. The currently pattern we detect are (canonical)
cycles. If <code>T: Send</code> relies on <code>T: Send</code> then it's pretty clear that this will just go on forever.</p>
<p>With cycles we have to be careful with caching. Because of canonicalization of regions and
inference variables encountering a cycle doesn't mean that we would get an infinite proof tree.
Looking at the following example:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>trait Foo {}
struct Wrapper&lt;T&gt;(T);

impl&lt;T&gt; Foo for Wrapper&lt;Wrapper&lt;T&gt;&gt;
where
    Wrapper&lt;T&gt;: Foo
{} 
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Proving <code>Wrapper&lt;?0&gt;: Foo</code> uses the impl <code>impl&lt;T&gt; Foo for Wrapper&lt;Wrapper&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code> which constrains
<code>?0</code> to <code>Wrapper&lt;?1&gt;</code> and then requires <code>Wrapper&lt;?1&gt;: Foo</code>. Due to canonicalization this would be
detected as a cycle.</p>
<p>The idea to solve is to return a <em>provisional result</em> whenever we detect a cycle and repeatedly
retry goals until the <em>provisional result</em> is equal to the final result of that goal. We
start out by using <code>Yes</code> with no constraints as the result and then update it to the result of
the previous iteration whenever we have to rerun.</p>
<p>TODO: elaborate here. We use the same approach as chalk for coinductive cycles.
Note that the treatment for inductive cycles currently differs by simply returning <code>Overflow</code>.
See <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/chalk/book/recursive/inductive_cycles.html">the relevant chapters</a> in the chalk book.</p>
<h2 id="future-work"><a class="header" href="#future-work">Future work</a></h2>
<p>We currently only consider auto-traits, <code>Sized</code>, and <code>WF</code>-goals to be coinductive.
In the future we pretty much intend for all goals to be coinductive.
Lets first elaborate on why allowing more coinductive proofs is even desirable.</p>
<h3 id="recursive-data-types-already-rely-on-coinduction"><a class="header" href="#recursive-data-types-already-rely-on-coinduction">Recursive data types already rely on coinduction...</a></h3>
<p>...they just tend to avoid them in the trait solver.</p>

<p>We are using <code>tail.clone()</code> in this impl. For this we have to prove <code>Box&lt;List&lt;T&gt;&gt;: Clone</code>
which requires <code>List&lt;T&gt;: Clone</code> but that relies on the impl which we are currently checking.
By adding that requirement to the <code>where</code>-clauses of the impl, which is what we would
do with <a href="https://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2022/04/12/implied-bounds-and-perfect-derive">perfect derive</a>, we move that cycle into the trait solver and <a href="https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2021&amp;gist=0a9c3830b93a2380e6978d6328df8f72">get an error</a>.</p>

<p>When checking an impl, we assume that the types in the impl headers are well-formed.
This means that when using instantiating the impl we have to prove that's actually the case.
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/100051">#100051</a> shows that this is not the case.
To fix this, we have to add <code>WF</code> predicates for the types in impl headers.
Without coinduction for all traits, this even breaks <code>core</code>.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]

<p>There are some additional issues to keep in mind when extending coinduction.
The issues here are not relevant for the current solver.</p>
<h4 id="implied-super-trait-bounds"><a class="header" href="#implied-super-trait-bounds">Implied super trait bounds</a></h4>
<p>Our trait system currently treats super traits, e.g. <code>trait Trait: SuperTrait</code>,
by 1) requiring that <code>SuperTrait</code> has to hold for all types which implement <code>Trait</code>,
and 2) assuming <code>SuperTrait</code> holds if <code>Trait</code> holds.</p>
<p>Relying on 2) while proving 1) is unsound. This can only be observed in case of
coinductive cycles. Without cycles, whenever we rely on 2) we must have also
proven 1) without relying on 2) for the used impl of <code>Trait</code>.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>trait Trait: SuperTrait {}

impl&lt;T: Trait&gt; Trait for T {}

// Keeping the current setup for coinduction

fn sup&lt;T: SuperTrait&gt;() {}

fn generic&lt;T&gt;() { requires_trait::&lt;T&gt;() }
<span class="boring">}

<p>This is not really fundamental to coinduction but rather an existing property
which is made unsound because of it.</p>
<h5 id="possible-solutions"><a class="header" href="#possible-solutions">Possible solutions</a></h5>
<p>The easiest way to solve this would be to completely remove 2) and always elaborate
<code>T: Trait</code> to <code>T: Trait</code> and <code>T: SuperTrait</code> outside of the trait solver.
This would allow us to also remove 1), but as we still have to prove ordinary
<code>where</code>-bounds on traits, that's just additional work.</p>
<p>While one could imagine ways to disable cyclic uses of 2) when checking 1),
at least the ideas of myself - @lcnr - are all far to complex to be reasonable.</p>
<h4 id="normalizes_to-goals-and-progress"><a class="header" href="#normalizes_to-goals-and-progress"><code>normalizes_to</code> goals and progress</a></h4>
<p>A <code>normalizes_to</code> goal represents the requirement that <code>&lt;T as Trait&gt;::Assoc</code> normalizes
to some <code>U</code>. This is achieved by defacto first normalizing <code>&lt;T as Trait&gt;::Assoc</code> and then
equating the resulting type with <code>U</code>. It should be a mapping as each projection should normalize
to exactly one type. By simply allowing infinite proof trees, we would get the following behavior:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>trait Trait {
    type Assoc;
}

impl Trait for () {
    type Assoc = &lt;() as Trait&gt;::Assoc;
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>If we now compute <code>normalizes_to(&lt;() as Trait&gt;::Assoc, Vec&lt;u32&gt;)</code>, we would resolve the impl
and get the associated type <code>&lt;() as Trait&gt;::Assoc</code>. We then equate that with the expected type,
causing us to check <code>normalizes_to(&lt;() as Trait&gt;::Assoc, Vec&lt;u32&gt;)</code> again.
This just goes on forever, resulting in an infinite proof tree.</p>
<p>This means that <code>&lt;() as Trait&gt;::Assoc</code> would be equal to any other type which is unsound.</p>
<h5 id="how-to-solve-this"><a class="header" href="#how-to-solve-this">How to solve this</a></h5>
<p><strong>WARNING: THIS IS SUBTLE AND MIGHT BE WRONG</strong></p>
<p>Unlike trait goals, <code>normalizes_to</code> has to be <em>productive</em><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup>. A <code>normalizes_to</code> goal
is productive once the projection normalizes to a rigid type constructor,
so <code>&lt;() as Trait&gt;::Assoc</code> normalizing to <code>Vec&lt;&lt;() as Trait&gt;::Assoc&gt;</code> would be productive.</p>
<p>A <code>normalizes_to</code> goal has two kinds of nested goals. Nested requirements needed to actually
normalize the projection, and the equality between the normalized projection and the
expected type. Only the equality has to be productive. A branch in the proof tree is productive
if it is either finite, or contains at least one <code>normalizes_to</code> where the alias is resolved
to a rigid type constructor.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we could simply always treat the equate branch of <code>normalizes_to</code> as inductive.
Any cycles should result in infinite types, which aren't supported anyways and would only
result in overflow when deeply normalizing for codegen.</p>
<p>experimentation and examples: https://hackmd.io/-8p0AHnzSq2VAE6HE_wX-w?view</p>
<p>Another attempt at a summary.</p>
<ul>
<li>in projection eq, we must make progress with constraining the rhs</li>
<li>a cycle is only ok if while equating we have a rigid ty on the lhs after norm at least once</li>
<li>cycles outside of the recursive <code>eq</code> call of <code>normalizes_to</code> are always fine</li>

as a bunch of related functionality.
Checking the bodies of functions is implemented in the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_hir_typeck/index.html"><code>hir_typeck</code></a> crate.
These crates draw heavily on the <a href="./type-inference.html">type inference</a> and <a href="./traits/resolution.html">trait solving</a>.</p>
<h2 id="type-collection"><a class="header" href="#type-collection">Type collection</a></h2>
<p>Type &quot;collection&quot; is the process of converting the types found in the HIR
(<code>hir::Ty</code>), which represent the syntactic things that the user wrote, into the
<strong>internal representation</strong> used by the compiler (<code>Ty&lt;'tcx&gt;</code>) – we also do
similar conversions for where-clauses and other bits of the function signature.</p>
<p>To try and get a sense for the difference, consider this function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">struct Foo { }
fn foo(x: Foo, y: self::Foo) { ... }
//        ^^^     ^^^^^^^^^
</code></pre>
<p>Those two parameters <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> each have the same type: but they will have
distinct <code>hir::Ty</code> nodes. Those nodes will have different spans, and of course
they encode the path somewhat differently. But once they are &quot;collected&quot; into
<code>Ty&lt;'tcx&gt;</code> nodes, they will be represented by the exact same internal type.</p>
<p>Collection is defined as a bundle of <a href="./query.html">queries</a> for computing information about
the various functions, traits, and other items in the crate being compiled.
Note that each of these queries is concerned with <em>interprocedural</em> things –
for example, for a function definition, collection will figure out the type and
signature of the function, but it will not visit the <em>body</em> of the function in
any way, nor examine type annotations on local variables (that's the job of
type <em>checking</em>).</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="method-lookup"><a class="header" href="#method-lookup">Method lookup</a></h1>
<p>Method lookup can be rather complex due to the interaction of a number
of factors, such as self types, autoderef, trait lookup, etc. This
file provides an overview of the process. More detailed notes are in
the code itself, naturally.</p>
<p>One way to think of method lookup is that we convert an expression of
the form <code>receiver.method(...)</code> into a more explicit <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/book/ch19-03-advanced-traits.html#fully-qualified-syntax-for-disambiguation-calling-methods-with-the-same-name">fully-qualified syntax</a>
(formerly called <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0132-ufcs.md">UFCS</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Trait::method(ADJ(receiver), ...)</code> for a trait call</li>
<li><code>ReceiverType::method(ADJ(receiver), ...)</code> for an inherent method call</li>
</ul>
<p>Here <code>ADJ</code> is some kind of adjustment, which is typically a series of
autoderefs and then possibly an autoref (e.g., <code>&amp;**receiver</code>). However
we sometimes do other adjustments and coercions along the way, in
particular unsizing (e.g., converting from <code>[T; n]</code> to <code>[T]</code>).</p>
<p>Method lookup is divided into two major phases:</p>
<ol>
<li>Probing (<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_hir_typeck/method/probe/"><code>probe.rs</code></a>). The probe phase is when we decide what method
to call and how to adjust the receiver.</li>
<li>Confirmation (<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_hir_typeck/method/confirm/"><code>confirm.rs</code></a>). The confirmation phase &quot;applies&quot;
this selection, updating the side-tables, unifying type variables, and
otherwise doing side-effectful things.</li>
</ol>
<p>One reason for this division is to be more amenable to caching.  The
probe phase produces a &quot;pick&quot; (<code>probe::Pick</code>), which is designed to be
cacheable across method-call sites. Therefore, it does not include
inference variables or other information.</p>
<h2 id="the-probe-phase"><a class="header" href="#the-probe-phase">The Probe phase</a></h2>
<h3 id="steps"><a class="header" href="#steps">Steps</a></h3>
<p>The first thing that the probe phase does is to create a series of
<em>steps</em>. This is done by progressively dereferencing the receiver type
until it cannot be deref'd anymore, as well as applying an optional
&quot;unsize&quot; step. So if the receiver has type <code>Rc&lt;Box&lt;[T; 3]&gt;&gt;</code>, this
might yield:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>Rc&lt;Box&lt;[T; 3]&gt;&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>Box&lt;[T; 3]&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>[T; 3]</code></li>
<li><code>[T]</code></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="candidate-assembly-1"><a class="header" href="#candidate-assembly-1">Candidate assembly</a></h3>
<p>We then search along those steps to create a list of <em>candidates</em>. A
<code>Candidate</code> is a method item that might plausibly be the method being
invoked. For each candidate, we'll derive a &quot;transformed self type&quot;
that takes into account explicit self.</p>
<p>Candidates are grouped into two kinds, inherent and extension.</p>
<p><strong>Inherent candidates</strong> are those that are derived from the
type of the receiver itself.  So, if you have a receiver of some
nominal type <code>Foo</code> (e.g., a struct), any methods defined within an
impl like <code>impl Foo</code> are inherent methods.  Nothing needs to be
imported to use an inherent method, they are associated with the type
itself (note that inherent impls can only be defined in the same
crate as the type itself).</p>
<p>FIXME: Inherent candidates are not always derived from impls.  If you
have a trait object, such as a value of type <code>Box&lt;ToString&gt;</code>, then the
trait methods (<code>to_string()</code>, in this case) are inherently associated
with it. Another case is type parameters, in which case the methods of
their bounds are inherent. However, this part of the rules is subject
to change: when DST's &quot;impl Trait for Trait&quot; is complete, trait object
dispatch could be subsumed into trait matching, and the type parameter
behavior should be reconsidered in light of where clauses.</p>
<p>TODO: Is this FIXME still accurate?</p>
<p><strong>Extension candidates</strong> are derived from imported traits.  If I have
the trait <code>ToString</code> imported, and I call <code>to_string()</code> as a method,
then we will list the <code>to_string()</code> definition in each impl of
<code>ToString</code> as a candidate. These kinds of method calls are called
&quot;extension methods&quot;.</p>
<p>So, let's continue our example. Imagine that we were calling a method
<code>foo</code> with the receiver <code>Rc&lt;Box&lt;[T; 3]&gt;&gt;</code> and there is a trait <code>Foo</code>
that defines it with <code>&amp;self</code> for the type <code>Rc&lt;U&gt;</code> as well as a method
on the type <code>Box</code> that defines <code>foo</code> but with <code>&amp;mut self</code>. Then we
might have two candidates:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&amp;Rc&lt;U&gt;</code> as an extension candidate</li>
<li><code>&amp;mut Box&lt;U&gt;</code> as an inherent candidate</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="candidate-search"><a class="header" href="#candidate-search">Candidate search</a></h3>
<p>Finally, to actually pick the method, we will search down the steps,
trying to match the receiver type against the candidate types. At
each step, we also consider an auto-ref and auto-mut-ref to see whether
that makes any of the candidates match. For each resulting receiver
type, we consider inherent candidates before extension candidates.
If there are multiple matching candidates in a group, we report an
error, except that multiple impls of the same trait are treated as a
single match. Otherwise we pick the first match we find.</p>
<p>In the case of our example, the first step is <code>Rc&lt;Box&lt;[T; 3]&gt;&gt;</code>,
which does not itself match any candidate. But when we autoref it, we
get the type <code>&amp;Rc&lt;Box&lt;[T; 3]&gt;&gt;</code> which matches <code>&amp;Rc&lt;U&gt;</code>. We would then
recursively consider all where-clauses that appear on the impl: if
those match (or we cannot rule out that they do), then this is the
method we would pick. Otherwise, we would continue down the series of
steps.</p>

<p>For a more general background on variance, see the <a href="./appendix/background.html">background</a> appendix.</p>
<p>During type checking we must infer the variance of type and lifetime
parameters. The algorithm is taken from Section 4 of the paper <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~yannis/variance-extended2011.pdf">&quot;Taming the
Wildcards: Combining Definition- and Use-Site Variance&quot;</a> published in
PLDI'11 and written by Altidor et al., and hereafter referred to as The Paper.</p>
<p>This inference is explicitly designed <em>not</em> to consider the uses of
types within code. To determine the variance of type parameters
defined on type <code>X</code>, we only consider the definition of the type <code>X</code>
and the definitions of any types it references.</p>
<p>We only infer variance for type parameters found on <em>data types</em>
like structs and enums. In these cases, there is a fairly straightforward
explanation for what variance means. The variance of the type
or lifetime parameters defines whether <code>T&lt;A&gt;</code> is a subtype of <code>T&lt;B&gt;</code>
(resp. <code>T&lt;'a&gt;</code> and <code>T&lt;'b&gt;</code>) based on the relationship of <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>
(resp. <code>'a</code> and <code>'b</code>).</p>
<p>We do not infer variance for type parameters found on traits, functions,
or impls. Variance on trait parameters can indeed make sense
(and we used to compute it) but it is actually rather subtle in
meaning and not that useful in practice, so we removed it. See the
<a href="variance.html#addendum">addendum</a> for some details. Variances on function/impl parameters, on the
other hand, doesn't make sense because these parameters are instantiated and
then forgotten, they don't persist in types or compiled byproducts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Notation</strong></p>
<p>We use the notation of The Paper throughout this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>+</code> is <em>covariance</em>.</li>
<li><code>-</code> is <em>contravariance</em>.</li>
<li><code>*</code> is <em>bivariance</em>.</li>
<li><code>o</code> is <em>invariance</em>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-algorithm"><a class="header" href="#the-algorithm">The algorithm</a></h2>
<p>The basic idea is quite straightforward. We iterate over the types
defined and, for each use of a type parameter <code>X</code>, accumulate a
constraint indicating that the variance of <code>X</code> must be valid for the
variance of that use site. We then iteratively refine the variance of
<code>X</code> until all constraints are met. There is <em>always</em> a solution, because at
the limit we can declare all type parameters to be invariant and all
constraints will be satisfied.</p>
<p>As a simple example, consider:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">enum Option&lt;A&gt; { Some(A), None }
enum OptionalFn&lt;B&gt; { Some(|B|), None }
enum OptionalMap&lt;C&gt; { Some(|C| -&gt; C), None }
</code></pre>
<p>Here, we will generate the constraints:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">1. V(A) &lt;= +
2. V(B) &lt;= -
3. V(C) &lt;= +
4. V(C) &lt;= -
</code></pre>
<p>These indicate that (1) the variance of A must be at most covariant;
(2) the variance of B must be at most contravariant; and (3, 4) the
variance of C must be at most covariant <em>and</em> contravariant. All of these
results are based on a variance lattice defined as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">   *      Top (bivariant)
-     +
   o      Bottom (invariant)
</code></pre>
<p>Based on this lattice, the solution <code>V(A)=+</code>, <code>V(B)=-</code>, <code>V(C)=o</code> is the
optimal solution. Note that there is always a naive solution which
just declares all variables to be invariant.</p>
<p>You may be wondering why fixed-point iteration is required. The reason
is that the variance of a use site may itself be a function of the
variance of other type parameters. In full generality, our constraints
take the form:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">V(X) &lt;= Term
Term := + | - | * | o | V(X) | Term x Term
</code></pre>
<p>Here the notation <code>V(X)</code> indicates the variance of a type/region
parameter <code>X</code> with respect to its defining class. <code>Term x Term</code>
represents the &quot;variance transform&quot; as defined in the paper:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the variance of a type variable <code>X</code> in type expression <code>E</code> is <code>V2</code>
and the definition-site variance of the corresponding type parameter
of a class <code>C</code> is <code>V1</code>, then the variance of <code>X</code> in the type expression
<code>C&lt;E&gt;</code> is <code>V3 = V1.xform(V2)</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="constraints-1"><a class="header" href="#constraints-1">Constraints</a></h2>
<p>If I have a struct or enum with where clauses:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">struct Foo&lt;T: Bar&gt; { ... }
</code></pre>
<p>you might wonder whether the variance of <code>T</code> with respect to <code>Bar</code> affects the
variance <code>T</code> with respect to <code>Foo</code>. I claim no.  The reason: assume that <code>T</code> is
invariant with respect to <code>Bar</code> but covariant with respect to <code>Foo</code>. And then
we have a <code>Foo&lt;X&gt;</code> that is upcast to <code>Foo&lt;Y&gt;</code>, where <code>X &lt;: Y</code>. However, while
<code>X : Bar</code>, <code>Y : Bar</code> does not hold.  In that case, the upcast will be illegal,
but not because of a variance failure, but rather because the target type
<code>Foo&lt;Y&gt;</code> is itself just not well-formed. Basically we get to assume
well-formedness of all types involved before considering variance.</p>
<h3 id="dependency-graph-management"><a class="header" href="#dependency-graph-management">Dependency graph management</a></h3>
<p>Because variance is a whole-crate inference, its dependency graph
can become quite muddled if we are not careful. To resolve this, we refactor
into two queries:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>crate_variances</code> computes the variance for all items in the current crate.</li>
<li><code>variances_of</code> accesses the variance for an individual reading; it
works by requesting <code>crate_variances</code> and extracting the relevant data.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you limit yourself to reading <code>variances_of</code>, your code will only
depend then on the inference of that particular item.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this setup relies on the <a href="./queries/incremental-compilation.html">red-green algorithm</a>. In particular,
every variance query effectively depends on all type definitions in the entire
crate (through <code>crate_variances</code>), but since most changes will not result in a
change to the actual results from variance inference, the <code>variances_of</code> query
will wind up being considered green after it is re-evaluated.</p>
<p><a name="addendum"></a></p>
<h2 id="addendum-variance-on-traits"><a class="header" href="#addendum-variance-on-traits">Addendum: Variance on traits</a></h2>
<p>As mentioned above, we used to permit variance on traits. This was
computed based on the appearance of trait type parameters in
method signatures and was used to represent the compatibility of
vtables in trait objects (and also &quot;virtual&quot; vtables or dictionary
in trait bounds). One complication was that variance for
associated types is less obvious, since they can be projected out
and put to myriad uses, so it's not clear when it is safe to allow
<code>X&lt;A&gt;::Bar</code> to vary (or indeed just what that means). Moreover (as
covered below) all inputs on any trait with an associated type had
to be invariant, limiting the applicability. Finally, the
annotations (<code>MarkerTrait</code>, <code>PhantomFn</code>) needed to ensure that all
trait type parameters had a variance were confusing and annoying
for little benefit.</p>
<p>Just for historical reference, I am going to preserve some text indicating how
one could interpret variance and trait matching.</p>
<h3 id="variance-and-object-types"><a class="header" href="#variance-and-object-types">Variance and object types</a></h3>
<p>Just as with structs and enums, we can decide the subtyping
relationship between two object types <code>&amp;Trait&lt;A&gt;</code> and <code>&amp;Trait&lt;B&gt;</code>
based on the relationship of <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>. Note that for object
types we ignore the <code>Self</code> type parameter – it is unknown, and
the nature of dynamic dispatch ensures that we will always call a
function that is expected the appropriate <code>Self</code> type. However, we
must be careful with the other type parameters, or else we could
end up calling a function that is expecting one type but provided
another.</p>
<p>To see what I mean, consider a trait like so:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>trait ConvertTo&lt;A&gt; {
    fn convertTo(&amp;self) -&gt; A;
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Intuitively, If we had one object <code>O=&amp;ConvertTo&lt;Object&gt;</code> and another
<code>S=&amp;ConvertTo&lt;String&gt;</code>, then <code>S &lt;: O</code> because <code>String &lt;: Object</code>
(presuming Java-like &quot;string&quot; and &quot;object&quot; types, my go to examples
for subtyping). The actual algorithm would be to compare the
(explicit) type parameters pairwise respecting their variance: here,
the type parameter A is covariant (it appears only in a return
position), and hence we require that <code>String &lt;: Object</code>.</p>
<p>You'll note though that we did not consider the binding for the
(implicit) <code>Self</code> type parameter: in fact, it is unknown, so that's
good. The reason we can ignore that parameter is precisely because we
don't need to know its value until a call occurs, and at that time (as
you said) the dynamic nature of virtual dispatch means the code we run
will be correct for whatever value <code>Self</code> happens to be bound to for
the particular object whose method we called. <code>Self</code> is thus different
from <code>A</code>, because the caller requires that <code>A</code> be known in order to
know the return type of the method <code>convertTo()</code>. (As an aside, we
have rules preventing methods where <code>Self</code> appears outside of the
receiver position from being called via an object.)</p>
<h3 id="trait-variance-and-vtable-resolution"><a class="header" href="#trait-variance-and-vtable-resolution">Trait variance and vtable resolution</a></h3>
<p>But traits aren't only used with objects. They're also used when
deciding whether a given impl satisfies a given trait bound. To set the
scene here, imagine I had a function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn convertAll&lt;A,T:ConvertTo&lt;A&gt;&gt;(v: &amp;[T]) { ... }
</code></pre>
<p>Now imagine that I have an implementation of <code>ConvertTo</code> for <code>Object</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">impl ConvertTo&lt;i32&gt; for Object { ... }
</code></pre>
<p>And I want to call <code>convertAll</code> on an array of strings. Suppose
further that for whatever reason I specifically supply the value of
<code>String</code> for the type parameter <code>T</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let mut vector = vec![&quot;string&quot;, ...];
convertAll::&lt;i32, String&gt;(vector);
</code></pre>
<p>Is this legal? To put another way, can we apply the <code>impl</code> for
<code>Object</code> to the type <code>String</code>? The answer is yes, but to see why
we have to expand out what will happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>convertAll</code> will create a pointer to one of the entries in the
vector, which will have type <code>&amp;String</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It will then call the impl of <code>convertTo()</code> that is intended
for use with objects. This has the type <code>fn(self: &amp;Object) -&gt; i32</code>.</p>
<p>It is OK to provide a value for <code>self</code> of type <code>&amp;String</code> because
<code>&amp;String &lt;: &amp;Object</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>OK, so intuitively we want this to be legal, so let's bring this back
to variance and see whether we are computing the correct result. We
must first figure out how to phrase the question &quot;is an impl for
<code>Object,i32</code> usable where an impl for <code>String,i32</code> is expected?&quot;</p>
<p>Maybe it's helpful to think of a dictionary-passing implementation of
type classes. In that case, <code>convertAll()</code> takes an implicit parameter
representing the impl. In short, we <em>have</em> an impl of type:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">V_O = ConvertTo&lt;i32&gt; for Object
</code></pre>
<p>and the function prototype expects an impl of type:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">V_S = ConvertTo&lt;i32&gt; for String
</code></pre>
<p>As with any argument, this is legal if the type of the value given
(<code>V_O</code>) is a subtype of the type expected (<code>V_S</code>). So is <code>V_O &lt;: V_S</code>?
The answer will depend on the variance of the various parameters. In
this case, because the <code>Self</code> parameter is contravariant and <code>A</code> is
covariant, it means that:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">V_O &lt;: V_S iff
    i32 &lt;: i32
    String &lt;: Object
</code></pre>
<p>These conditions are satisfied and so we are happy.</p>
<h3 id="variance-and-associated-types"><a class="header" href="#variance-and-associated-types">Variance and associated types</a></h3>
<p>Traits with associated types – or at minimum projection
expressions – must be invariant with respect to all of their
inputs. To see why this makes sense, consider what subtyping for a
trait reference means:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">&lt;T as Trait&gt; &lt;: &lt;U as Trait&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>means that if I know that <code>T as Trait</code>, I also know that <code>U as Trait</code>. Moreover, if you think of it as dictionary passing style,
it means that a dictionary for <code>&lt;T as Trait&gt;</code> is safe to use where
a dictionary for <code>&lt;U as Trait&gt;</code> is expected.</p>
<p>The problem is that when you can project types out from <code>&lt;T as Trait&gt;</code>, the relationship to types projected out of <code>&lt;U as Trait&gt;</code>
is completely unknown unless <code>T==U</code> (see #21726 for more
details). Making <code>Trait</code> invariant ensures that this is true.</p>
<p>Another related reason is that if we didn't make traits with
associated types invariant, then projection is no longer a
function with a single result. Consider:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">trait Identity { type Out; fn foo(&amp;self); }
impl&lt;T&gt; Identity for T { type Out = T; ... }
</code></pre>
<p>Now if I have <code>&lt;&amp;'static () as Identity&gt;::Out</code>, this can be
validly derived as <code>&amp;'a ()</code> for any <code>'a</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">&lt;&amp;'a () as Identity&gt; &lt;: &lt;&amp;'static () as Identity&gt;
if &amp;'static () &lt; : &amp;'a ()   -- Identity is contravariant in Self
if 'static : 'a             -- Subtyping rules for relations
</code></pre>
<p>This change otoh means that <code>&lt;'static () as Identity&gt;::Out</code> is
always <code>&amp;'static ()</code> (which might then be upcast to <code>'a ()</code>,
separately). This was helpful in solving #21750.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="opaque-types-type-alias-impl-trait"><a class="header" href="#opaque-types-type-alias-impl-trait">Opaque types (type alias <code>impl Trait</code>)</a></h1>
<p>Opaque types are syntax to declare an opaque type alias that only
exposes a specific set of traits as their interface; the concrete type in the
background is inferred from a certain set of use sites of the opaque type.</p>
<p>This is expressed by using <code>impl Trait</code> within type aliases, for example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">type Foo = impl Bar;
</code></pre>
<p>This declares an opaque type named <code>Foo</code>, of which the only information is that
it implements <code>Bar</code>. Therefore, any of <code>Bar</code>'s interface can be used on a <code>Foo</code>,
but nothing else (regardless of whether it implements any other traits).</p>
<p>Since there needs to be a concrete background type,
you can (as of <!-- date-check --> January 2021) express that type
by using the opaque type in a &quot;defining use site&quot;.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">struct Struct;
impl Bar for Struct { /* stuff */ }
fn foo() -&gt; Foo {
    Struct
}
</code></pre>
<p>Any other &quot;defining use site&quot; needs to produce the exact same type.</p>
<h2 id="defining-use-sites"><a class="header" href="#defining-use-sites">Defining use site(s)</a></h2>
<p>Currently only the return value of a function can be a defining use site
of an opaque type (and only if the return type of that function contains
the opaque type).</p>
<p>The defining use of an opaque type can be any code <em>within</em> the parent
of the opaque type definition. This includes any siblings of the
opaque type and all children of the siblings.</p>
<p>The initiative for <em>&quot;not causing fatal brain damage to developers due to
accidentally running infinite loops in their brain while trying to
comprehend what the type system is doing&quot;</em> has decided to disallow children
of opaque types to be defining use sites.</p>
<h3 id="associated-opaque-types"><a class="header" href="#associated-opaque-types">Associated opaque types</a></h3>
<p>Associated opaque types can be defined by any other associated item
on the same trait <code>impl</code> or a child of these associated items. For instance:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">trait Baz {
    type Foo;
    fn foo() -&gt; Self::Foo;
}

struct Quux;

impl Baz for Quux {
    type Foo = impl Bar;

This kind of type inference is particularly complex because,

it can work across functions and function bodies.</p>
<h2 id="running-example"><a class="header" href="#running-example">Running example</a></h2>
<p>To help explain how it works, let's consider an example.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">mod m {
    pub type Seq&lt;T&gt; = impl IntoIterator&lt;Item = T&gt;;

    pub fn produce_singleton&lt;T&gt;(t: T) -&gt; Seq&lt;T&gt; {
        vec![t]
    }

    pub fn produce_doubleton&lt;T&gt;(t: T, u: T) -&gt; Seq&lt;T&gt; {
        vec![t, u]
    }
}

fn is_send&lt;T: Send&gt;(_: &amp;T) {}

pub fn main() {
    let elems = m::produce_singleton(22);

    is_send(&amp;elems);

    for elem in elems {
        println!(&quot;elem = {:?}&quot;, elem);
    }
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>In this code, the <em>opaque type</em> is <code>Seq&lt;T&gt;</code>.
Its defining scope is the module <code>m</code>.
Its <em>hidden type</em> is <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code>,
which is inferred from <code>m::produce_singleton</code> and <code>m::produce_doubleton</code>.</p>
<p>In the <code>main</code> function, the opaque type is out of its defining scope.
When <code>main</code> calls <code>m::produce_singleton</code>, it gets back a reference to the opaque type <code>Seq&lt;i32&gt;</code>.
The <code>is_send</code> call checks that <code>Seq&lt;i32&gt;: Send</code>.
<code>Send</code> is not listed amongst the bounds of the impl trait,
but because of auto-trait leakage, we are able to infer that it holds.
The <code>for</code> loop desugaring requires that <code>Seq&lt;T&gt;: IntoIterator</code>,
which is provable from the bounds declared on <code>Seq&lt;T&gt;</code>.</p>
<h3 id="type-checking-main"><a class="header" href="#type-checking-main">Type-checking <code>main</code></a></h3>
<p>Let's start by looking what happens when we type-check <code>main</code>.
Initially we invoke <code>produce_singleton</code> and the return type is an opaque type
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_hir/enum.ItemKind.html#variant.OpaqueTy"><code>OpaqueTy</code></a>.</p>
<h4 id="type-checking-the-for-loop"><a class="header" href="#type-checking-the-for-loop">Type-checking the for loop</a></h4>
<p>The for loop desugars the <code>in elems</code> part to <code>IntoIterator::into_iter(elems)</code>.
<code>elems</code> is of type <code>Seq&lt;T&gt;</code>, so the type checker registers a <code>Seq&lt;T&gt;: IntoIterator</code> obligation.
This obligation is trivially satisfied,
because <code>Seq&lt;T&gt;</code> is an opaque type (<code>impl IntoIterator&lt;Item = T&gt;</code>) that has a bound for the trait.
Similar to how a <code>U: Foo</code> where bound allows <code>U</code> to trivially satisfy <code>Foo</code>,
opaque types' bounds are available to the type checker and are used to fulfill obligations.</p>
<p>The type of <code>elem</code> in the for loop is inferred to be <code>&lt;Seq&lt;T&gt; as IntoIterator&gt;::Item</code>, which is <code>T</code>.
At no point is the type checker interested in the hidden type.</p>
<h4 id="type-checking-the-is_send-call"><a class="header" href="#type-checking-the-is_send-call">Type-checking the <code>is_send</code> call</a></h4>
<p>When trying to prove auto trait bounds,
we first repeat the process as above,
to see if the auto trait is in the bound list of the opaque type.
If that fails, we reveal the hidden type of the opaque type,
but only to prove this specific trait bound, not in general.
Revealing is done by invoking the <code>type_of</code> query on the <code>DefId</code> of the opaque type.
The query will internally request the hidden types from the defining function(s)
and return that (see <a href="opaque-types-impl-trait-inference.html#Within-the-type_of-query">the section on <code>type_of</code></a> for more details).</p>

<p>There is one central place where an opaque type gets its hidden type constrained,
and that is the <code>handle_opaque_type</code> function.
Amusingly it takes two types, so you can pass any two types,
but one of them should be an opaque type.
The order is only important for diagnostics.</p>

<h3 id="interactions-with-queries"><a class="header" href="#interactions-with-queries">Interactions with queries</a></h3>
<p>When queries handle opaque types,
they cannot figure out whether they are in a defining scope,
so they just assume they are.</p>
<p>The registered hidden types are stored into the <code>QueryResponse</code> struct
in the <code>opaque_types</code> field (the function
<code>take_opaque_types_for_query_response</code> reads them out).</p>
<p>When the <code>QueryResponse</code> is instantiated into the surrounding infcx in
<code>query_response_substitution_guess</code>,
we convert each hidden type constraint by invoking <code>handle_opaque_type</code> (as above).</p>
<p>There is one bit of &quot;weirdness&quot;.
The instantiated opaque types have an order
(if one opaque type was compared with another,
and we have to pick one opaque type to use as the one that gets its hidden type assigned).
We use the one that is considered &quot;expected&quot;.
But really both of the opaque types may have defining uses.
When the query result is instantiated,
that will be re-evaluated from the context that is using the query.
The final context (typeck of a function, mir borrowck or wf-checks)
will know which opaque type can actually be instantiated
and then handle it correctly.</p>
<h3 id="within-the-mir-borrow-checker"><a class="header" href="#within-the-mir-borrow-checker">Within the MIR borrow checker</a></h3>
<p>The MIR borrow checker relates things via <code>nll_relate</code> and only cares about regions.
Any type relation will trigger the binding of hidden types,
so the borrow checker is doing the same thing as the type checker,
but ignores obviously dead code (e.g. after a panic).
The borrow checker is also the source of truth when it comes to hidden types,
as it is the only one who can properly figure out what lifetimes on the hidden type correspond
to which lifetimes on the opaque type declaration.</p>
<h2 id="backwards-compatibility-hacks"><a class="header" href="#backwards-compatibility-hacks">Backwards compatibility hacks</a></h2>
<p><code>impl Trait</code> in return position has various quirks that were not part
of any RFCs and are likely accidental stabilization.
To support these,
the <code>replace_opaque_types_with_inference_vars</code> is being used to reintroduce the previous behaviour.</p>
<p>There are three backwards compatibility hacks:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>All return sites share the same inference variable,
so some return sites may only compile if another return site uses a concrete type.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]

    }
    vec![42]
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Associated type equality constraints for <code>impl Trait</code> can be used
as long as the hidden type  satisfies the trait bounds on the associated type.
The opaque <code>impl Trait</code> signature does not need to satisfy them.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>trait Duh {}

impl Duh for i32 {}

trait Trait {

// an intermediate inference var to be generated which is then later
// compared against the actually found `Assoc` type.
impl&lt;R: Duh, F: FnMut() -&gt; R&gt; Trait for F {
    type Assoc = R;
}

// The `impl Send` here is then later compared against the inference var
// created, causing the inference var to be set to `impl Send` instead of
// the hidden type. We already have obligations registered on the inference
// var to make it uphold the `: Duh` bound on `Trait::Assoc`. The opaque
// type does not implement `Duh`, even if its hidden type does.
// Lazy TAIT would error out, but we inserted a hack to make it work again,
// keeping backwards compatibility.

}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Closures cannot create hidden types for their parent function's <code>impl Trait</code>.
This point is mostly moot,
because of point 1 introducing inference vars,
so the closure only ever sees the inference var, but should we fix 1, this will become a problem.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="pattern-and-exhaustiveness-checking"><a class="header" href="#pattern-and-exhaustiveness-checking">Pattern and Exhaustiveness Checking</a></h1>
<p>In Rust, pattern matching and bindings have a few very helpful properties. The
compiler will check that bindings are irrefutable when made and that match arms
are exhaustive.</p>
<h2 id="pattern-usefulness"><a class="header" href="#pattern-usefulness">Pattern usefulness</a></h2>
<p>The central question that usefulness checking answers is:
&quot;in this match expression, is that branch reachable?&quot;.
More precisely, it boils down to computing whether,
given a list of patterns we have already seen,
a given new pattern might match any new value.</p>
<p>For example, in the following match expression,
we ask in turn whether each pattern might match something
that wasn't matched by the patterns above it.
Here we see the 4th pattern is redundant with the 1st;
that branch will get an &quot;unreachable&quot; warning.
The 3rd pattern may or may not be useful,
depending on whether <code>Foo</code> has other variants than <code>Bar</code>.
Finally, we can ask whether the whole match is exhaustive
by asking whether the wildcard pattern (<code>_</code>)
is useful relative to the list of all the patterns in that match.
Here we can see that <code>_</code> is useful (it would catch <code>(false, None)</code>);
this expression would therefore get a &quot;non-exhaustive match&quot; error.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>// x: (bool, Option&lt;Foo&gt;)
match x {
    (true, _) =&gt; {} // 1
    (false, Some(Foo::Bar)) =&gt; {} // 2
    (false, Some(_)) =&gt; {} // 3
    (true, None) =&gt; {} // 4
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Thus usefulness is used for two purposes:
detecting unreachable code (which is useful to the user),
and ensuring that matches are exhaustive (which is important for soundness,
because a match expression can return a value).</p>
<h2 id="where-it-happens"><a class="header" href="#where-it-happens">Where it happens</a></h2>
<p>This check is done to any expression that desugars to a match expression in MIR.
That includes actual <code>match</code> expressions,
but also anything that looks like pattern matching,
including <code>if let</code>, destructuring <code>let</code>, and similar expressions.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]

<p>If you work on the MIR, you will frequently come across various flavors of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-flow_analysis#Basic_principles">dataflow analysis</a>. <code>rustc</code> uses dataflow to find uninitialized
variables, determine what variables are live across a generator <code>yield</code>
statement, and compute which <code>Place</code>s are borrowed at a given point in the
control-flow graph. Dataflow analysis is a fundamental concept in modern
compilers, and knowledge of the subject will be helpful to prospective
contributors.</p>
<p>However, this documentation is not a general introduction to dataflow analysis.
It is merely a description of the framework used to define these analyses in
<code>rustc</code>. It assumes that the reader is familiar with the core ideas as well as
some basic terminology, such as &quot;transfer function&quot;, &quot;fixpoint&quot; and &quot;lattice&quot;.
If you're unfamiliar with these terms, or if you want a quick refresher,
<a href="https://cs.au.dk/~amoeller/spa/"><em>Static Program Analysis</em></a> by Anders Møller and Michael I. Schwartzbach is an
excellent, freely available textbook. For those who prefer audiovisual
learning, we previously recommended a series of short lectures
by the Goethe University Frankfurt on YouTube, but it has since been deleted.
See <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-dev-guide/pull/1295">this PR</a> for the context and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-dev-guide/pull/1295#issuecomment-1118131294">this comment</a>
for the alternative lectures.</p>
<h2 id="defining-a-dataflow-analysis"><a class="header" href="#defining-a-dataflow-analysis">Defining a Dataflow Analysis</a></h2>
<p>The interface for dataflow analyses is split into three traits. The first is
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_dataflow/trait.AnalysisDomain.html"><code>AnalysisDomain</code></a>, which must be implemented by <em>all</em> analyses. In addition to
the type of the dataflow state, this trait defines the initial value of that
state at entry to each block, as well as the direction of the analysis, either
forward or backward. The domain of your dataflow analysis must be a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_(order)">lattice</a>
(strictly speaking a join-semilattice) with a well-behaved <code>join</code> operator. See
documentation for the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_dataflow/lattice/index.html"><code>lattice</code></a> module, as well as the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_dataflow/lattice/trait.JoinSemiLattice.html"><code>JoinSemiLattice</code></a>
trait, for more information.</p>
<p>You must then provide <em>either</em> a direct implementation of the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_dataflow/trait.Analysis.html"><code>Analysis</code></a> trait
<em>or</em> an implementation of the proxy trait <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_dataflow/trait.GenKillAnalysis.html"><code>GenKillAnalysis</code></a>. The latter is for
so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data-flow_analysis#Bit_vector_problems">&quot;gen-kill&quot; problems</a>, which have a simple class of transfer function
that can be applied very efficiently. Analyses whose domain is not a <code>BitSet</code>
of some index type, or whose transfer functions cannot be expressed through
&quot;gen&quot; and &quot;kill&quot; operations, must implement <code>Analysis</code> directly, and will run
slower as a result. All implementers of <code>GenKillAnalysis</code> also implement
<code>Analysis</code> automatically via a default <code>impl</code>.</p>

<h3 id="transfer-functions-and-effects"><a class="header" href="#transfer-functions-and-effects">Transfer Functions and Effects</a></h3>
<p>The dataflow framework in <code>rustc</code> allows each statement (and terminator) inside
a basic block to define its own transfer function. For brevity, these
individual transfer functions are known as &quot;effects&quot;. Each effect is applied
successively in dataflow order, and together they define the transfer function
for the entire basic block. It's also possible to define an effect for
particular outgoing edges of some terminators (e.g.
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_dataflow/trait.Analysis.html#tymethod.apply_call_return_effect"><code>apply_call_return_effect</code></a> for the <code>success</code> edge of a <code>Call</code>
terminator). Collectively, these are referred to as &quot;per-edge effects&quot;.</p>
<p>The only meaningful difference (besides the &quot;apply&quot; prefix) between the methods
of the <code>GenKillAnalysis</code> trait and the <code>Analysis</code> trait is that an <code>Analysis</code>
has direct, mutable access to the dataflow state, whereas a <code>GenKillAnalysis</code>
only sees an implementer of the <code>GenKill</code> trait, which only allows the <code>gen</code>
and <code>kill</code> operations for mutation.</p>
<h3 id="before-effects"><a class="header" href="#before-effects">&quot;Before&quot; Effects</a></h3>
<p>Observant readers of the documentation may notice that there are actually <em>two</em>
possible effects for each statement and terminator, the &quot;before&quot; effect and the
unprefixed (or &quot;primary&quot;) effect. The &quot;before&quot; effects are applied immediately
before the unprefixed effect <strong>regardless of the direction of the analysis</strong>.
In other words, a backward analysis will apply the &quot;before&quot; effect and then the
&quot;primary&quot; effect when computing the transfer function for a basic block, just
like a forward analysis.</p>
<p>The vast majority of analyses should use only the unprefixed effects: Having
multiple effects for each statement makes it difficult for consumers to know
where they should be looking. However, the &quot;before&quot; variants can be useful in
some scenarios, such as when the effect of the right-hand side of an assignment
statement must be considered separately from the left-hand side.</p>
<h3 id="convergence"><a class="header" href="#convergence">Convergence</a></h3>
<p>Your analysis must converge to &quot;fixpoint&quot;, otherwise it will run forever.
Converging to fixpoint is just another way of saying &quot;reaching equilibrium&quot;.
In order to reach equilibrium, your analysis must obey some laws. One of the
laws it must obey is that the bottom value<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#bottom-purpose">1</a></sup> joined with some
other value equals the second value. Or, as an equation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>bottom</em> join <em>x</em> = <em>x</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another law is that your analysis must have a &quot;top value&quot; such that</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>top</em> join <em>x</em> = <em>top</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Having a top value ensures that your semilattice has a finite height, and the
law state above ensures that once the dataflow state reaches top, it will no
longer change (the fixpoint will be top).</p>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="bottom-purpose"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>The bottom value's primary purpose is as the initial dataflow
state. Each basic block's entry state is initialized to bottom before the
analysis starts.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="a-brief-example"><a class="header" href="#a-brief-example">A Brief Example</a></h2>
<p>This section provides a brief example of a simple data-flow analysis at a high
level. It doesn't explain everything you need to know, but hopefully it will
make the rest of this page clearer.</p>
<p>Let's say we want to do a simple analysis to find if <code>mem::transmute</code> may have
been called by a certain point in the program. Our analysis domain will just
be a <code>bool</code> that records whether <code>transmute</code> has been called so far. The bottom
value will be <code>false</code>, since by default <code>transmute</code> has not been called. The top
value will be <code>true</code>, since our analysis is done as soon as we determine that
<code>transmute</code> has been called. Our join operator will just be the boolean OR (<code>||</code>)
operator. We use OR and not AND because of this case:</p>
<pre><code>let x = if some_cond {
    std::mem::transmute&lt;i32, u32&gt;(0_i32); // transmute was called!
} else {
    1_u32; // transmute was not called
};

// Has transmute been called by this point? We conservatively approximate that
// as yes, and that is why we use the OR operator.
println!(&quot;x: {}&quot;, x);
</code></pre>
<h2 id="inspecting-the-results-of-a-dataflow-analysis"><a class="header" href="#inspecting-the-results-of-a-dataflow-analysis">Inspecting the Results of a Dataflow Analysis</a></h2>
<p>Once you have constructed an analysis, you must pass it to an <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_dataflow/struct.Engine.html"><code>Engine</code></a>, which
is responsible for finding the steady-state solution to your dataflow problem.
You should use the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_dataflow/trait.Analysis.html#method.into_engine"><code>into_engine</code></a> method defined on the <code>Analysis</code> trait for
this, since it will use the more efficient <code>Engine::new_gen_kill</code> constructor
when possible.</p>
<p>Calling <code>iterate_to_fixpoint</code> on your <code>Engine</code> will return a <code>Results</code>, which
contains the dataflow state at fixpoint upon entry of each block. Once you have
a <code>Results</code>, you can inspect the dataflow state at fixpoint at any point in
the CFG. If you only need the state at a few locations (e.g., each <code>Drop</code>
terminator) use a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_dataflow/struct.ResultsCursor.html"><code>ResultsCursor</code></a>. If you need the state at <em>every</em> location,
a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_dataflow/trait.ResultsVisitor.html"><code>ResultsVisitor</code></a> will be more efficient.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When an initialized variable or temporary goes out of scope, its destructor
is run, or it is dropped. Assignment also runs the destructor of its
left-hand operand, if it's initialized. If a variable has been partially
initialized, only its initialized fields are dropped.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When building the MIR, the <code>Drop</code> and <code>DropAndReplace</code> terminators represent
places where drops may occur. However, in this phase, the presence of these
terminators does not guarantee that a destructor will run. That's because the
target of a drop may be uninitialized (usually because it has been moved from)
before the terminator is reached. In general, we cannot know at compile-time whether a
variable is initialized.</p>

<p>In these cases, we need to keep track of whether a variable is initialized
<em>dynamically</em>. The rules are laid out in detail in <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/0320-nonzeroing-dynamic-drop.html">RFC 320: Non-zeroing
dynamic drops</a>.</p>
<h2 id="drop-obligations"><a class="header" href="#drop-obligations">Drop obligations</a></h2>
<p>From the RFC:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a local variable becomes initialized, it establishes a set of &quot;drop
obligations&quot;: a set of structural paths (e.g. a local <code>a</code>, or a path to a
field <code>b.f.y</code>) that need to be dropped.</p>
<p>The drop obligations for a local variable x of struct-type <code>T</code> are computed
from analyzing the structure of <code>T</code>. If <code>T</code> itself implements <code>Drop</code>, then <code>x</code> is a
drop obligation. If <code>T</code> does not implement <code>Drop</code>, then the set of drop
obligations is the union of the drop obligations of the fields of <code>T</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When a structural path is moved from (and thus becomes uninitialized), any drop
obligations for that path or its descendants (<code>path.f</code>, <code>path.f.g.h</code>, etc.) are
released. Types with <code>Drop</code> implementations do not permit moves from individual
fields, so there is no need to track initializedness through them.</p>
<p>When a local variable goes out of scope (<code>Drop</code>), or when a structural path is
overwritten via assignment (<code>DropAndReplace</code>), we check for any drop
obligations for that variable or path.  Unless that obligation has been
released by this point, its associated <code>Drop</code> implementation will be called.
For <code>enum</code> types, only fields corresponding to the &quot;active&quot; variant need to be
dropped. When processing drop obligations for such types, we first check the
discriminant to determine the active variant. All drop obligations for variants
besides the active one are ignored.</p>
<p>Here are a few interesting types to help illustrate these rules:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>struct NoDrop(u8); // No `Drop` impl. No fields with `Drop` impls.

struct NeedsDrop(Vec&lt;u8&gt;); // No `Drop` impl but has fields with `Drop` impls.

struct ThinVec(*const u8); // Custom `Drop` impl. Individual fields cannot be moved from.

impl Drop for ThinVec {
    fn drop(&amp;mut self) { /* ... */ }
}

enum MaybeDrop {
    Yes(NeedsDrop),
    No(NoDrop),
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<h2 id="drop-elaboration-1"><a class="header" href="#drop-elaboration-1">Drop elaboration</a></h2>
<p>One valid model for these rules is to keep a boolean flag (a &quot;drop flag&quot;) for
every structural path that is used at any point in the function. This flag is
set when its path is initialized and is cleared when the path is moved from.
When a <code>Drop</code> occurs, we check the flags for every obligation associated with
the target of the <code>Drop</code> and call the associated <code>Drop</code> impl for those that are
still applicable.</p>
<p>This process—transforming the newly built MIR with its imprecise <code>Drop</code> and
<code>DropAndReplace</code> terminators into one with drop flags—is known as drop
elaboration. When a MIR statement causes a variable to become initialized (or
uninitialized), drop elaboration inserts code that sets (or clears) the drop
flag for that variable. It wraps <code>Drop</code> terminators in conditionals that check
the newly inserted drop flags.</p>
<p>Drop elaboration also splits <code>DropAndReplace</code> terminators into a <code>Drop</code> of the
target and a write of the newly dropped place. This is somewhat unrelated to what
we've discussed above.</p>
<p>Once this is complete, <code>Drop</code> terminators in the MIR correspond to a call to
the &quot;drop glue&quot; or &quot;drop shim&quot; for the type of the dropped place. The drop
glue for a type calls the <code>Drop</code> impl for that type (if one exists), and then
recursively calls the drop glue for all fields of that type.</p>
<h2 id="drop-elaboration-in-rustc"><a class="header" href="#drop-elaboration-in-rustc">Drop elaboration in <code>rustc</code></a></h2>
<p>The approach described above is more expensive than necessary. One can imagine
a few optimizations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only paths that are the target of a <code>Drop</code> (or have the target as a prefix)
need drop flags.</li>
<li>Some variables are known to be initialized (or uninitialized) when they are
dropped. These do not need drop flags.</li>
<li>If a set of paths are only dropped or moved from via a shared prefix, those
paths can share a single drop flag.</li>
</ul>
<p>A subset of these are implemented in <code>rustc</code>.</p>
<p>In the compiler, drop elaboration is split across several modules. The pass
itself is defined <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/compiler/rustc_mir_dataflow/src/elaborate_drops.rs">here</a>, but the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/compiler/rustc_mir_dataflow/src/elaborate_drops.rs">main logic</a> is
defined elsewhere since it is also used to build <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/compiler/rustc_mir_transform/src/shim.rs">drop shims</a>.</p>
<p>Drop elaboration designates each <code>Drop</code> in the newly built MIR as one of four
kinds:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Static</code>, the target is always initialized.</li>
<li><code>Dead</code>, the target is always <strong>un</strong>initialized.</li>
<li><code>Conditional</code>, the target is either wholly initialized or wholly
uninitialized. It is not partly initialized.</li>
<li><code>Open</code>, the target may be partly initialized.</li>
</ul>
<p>For this, it uses a pair of dataflow analyses, <code>MaybeInitializedPlaces</code> and
<code>MaybeUninitializedPlaces</code>. If a place is in one but not the other, then the
initializedness of the target is known at compile-time (<code>Dead</code> or <code>Static</code>).
In this case, drop elaboration does not add a flag for the target. It simply
removes (<code>Dead</code>) or preserves (<code>Static</code>) the <code>Drop</code> terminator.</p>
<p>For <code>Conditional</code> drops, we know that the initializedness of the variable as a
whole is the same as the initializedness of its fields. Therefore, once we
generate a drop flag for the target of that drop, it's safe to call the drop
glue for that target.</p>
<h3 id="open-drops"><a class="header" href="#open-drops"><code>Open</code> drops</a></h3>
<p><code>Open</code> drops are the most complex, since we need to break down a single <code>Drop</code>
terminator into several different ones, one for each field of the target whose
type has drop glue (<code>Ty::needs_drop</code>). We cannot call the drop glue for the
target itself because that requires all fields of the target to be initialized.
Remember, variables whose type has a custom <code>Drop</code> impl do not allow <code>Open</code>
drops because their fields cannot be moved from.</p>
<p>This is accomplished by recursively categorizing each field as <code>Dead</code>,
<code>Static</code>, <code>Conditional</code> or <code>Open</code>. Fields whose type does not have drop glue
are automatically <code>Dead</code> and need not be considered during the recursion. When
we reach a field whose kind is not <code>Open</code>, we handle it as we did above. If the
field is also <code>Open</code>, the recursion continues.</p>
<p>It's worth noting how we handle <code>Open</code> drops of enums. Inside drop elaboration,
each variant of the enum is treated like a field, with the invariant that only
one of those &quot;variant fields&quot; can be initialized at any given time. In the
general case, we do not know which variant is the active one, so we will have
to call the drop glue for the enum (which checks the discriminant) or check the
discriminant ourselves as part of an elaborated <code>Open</code> drop. However, in
certain cases (within a <code>match</code> arm, for example) we do know which variant of
an enum is active. This information is encoded in the <code>MaybeInitializedPlaces</code>
and <code>MaybeUninitializedPlaces</code> dataflow analyses by marking all places
corresponding to inactive variants as uninitialized.</p>
<h3 id="cleanup-paths"><a class="header" href="#cleanup-paths">Cleanup paths</a></h3>
<p>TODO: Discuss drop elaboration and unwinding.</p>
<h2 id="aside-drop-elaboration-and-const-eval"><a class="header" href="#aside-drop-elaboration-and-const-eval">Aside: drop elaboration and const-eval</a></h2>
<p>In Rust, functions that are eligible for evaluation at compile-time must be
marked explicitly using the <code>const</code> keyword. This includes implementations  of
the <code>Drop</code> trait, which may or may not be <code>const</code>. Code that is eligible for
compile-time evaluation may only call <code>const</code> functions, so any calls to
non-const <code>Drop</code> implementations in such code must be forbidden.</p>
<p>A call to a <code>Drop</code> impl is encoded as a <code>Drop</code> terminator in the MIR. However,
as we discussed above, a <code>Drop</code> terminator in newly built MIR does not
necessarily result in a call to <code>Drop::drop</code>. The drop target may be
uninitialized at that point. This means that checking for non-const <code>Drop</code>s on
the newly built MIR can result in spurious errors. Instead, we wait until after
drop elaboration runs, which eliminates <code>Dead</code> drops (ones where the target is
known to be uninitialized) to run these checks.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="mir-borrow-check"><a class="header" href="#mir-borrow-check">MIR borrow check</a></h1>
<p>The borrow check is Rust's &quot;secret sauce&quot; – it is tasked with
enforcing a number of properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>That all variables are initialized before they are used.</li>
<li>That you can't move the same value twice.</li>
<li>That you can't move a value while it is borrowed.</li>
<li>That you can't access a place while it is mutably borrowed (except through
the reference).</li>
<li>That you can't mutate a place while it is immutably borrowed.</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>
<p>The borrow checker operates on the MIR. An older implementation operated on the
HIR. Doing borrow checking on MIR has several advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>The MIR is <em>far</em> less complex than the HIR; the radical desugaring
helps prevent bugs in the borrow checker. (If you're curious, you
can see
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/47366">a list of bugs that the MIR-based borrow checker fixes here</a>.)</li>
<li>Even more importantly, using the MIR enables <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/2094-nll.html">&quot;non-lexical lifetimes&quot;</a>,
which are regions derived from the control-flow graph.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="major-phases-of-the-borrow-checker"><a class="header" href="#major-phases-of-the-borrow-checker">Major phases of the borrow checker</a></h3>
<p>The borrow checker source is found in
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_borrowck/index.html">the <code>rustc_borrowck</code> crate</a>. The main entry point is
the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_borrowck/fn.mir_borrowck.html"><code>mir_borrowck</code></a> query.</p>
<ul>
<li>We first create a <strong>local copy</strong> of the MIR. In the coming steps,
we will modify this copy in place to modify the types and things to
include references to the new regions that we are computing.</li>
<li>We then invoke <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_borrowck/nll/fn.replace_regions_in_mir.html"><code>replace_regions_in_mir</code></a> to modify our local MIR.
Among other things, this function will replace all of the <a href="./appendix/glossary.html#region">regions</a>
in the MIR with fresh <a href="./appendix/glossary.html#inf-var">inference variables</a>.</li>
<li>Next, we perform a number of
<a href="./appendix/background.html#dataflow">dataflow analyses</a> that
compute what data is moved and when.</li>
<li>We then do a <a href="borrow_check/type_check.html">second type check</a> across the MIR:
the purpose of this type check is to determine all of the constraints between
different regions.</li>
<li>Next, we do <a href="borrow_check/region_inference.html">region inference</a>, which computes
the values of each region — basically, the points in the control-flow graph where
each lifetime must be valid according to the constraints we collected.</li>
<li>At this point, we can compute the &quot;borrows in scope&quot; at each point.</li>
<li>Finally, we do a second walk over the MIR, looking at the actions it
does and reporting errors. For example, if we see a statement like
<code>*a + 1</code>, then we would check that the variable <code>a</code> is initialized
and that it is not mutably borrowed, as either of those would
require an error to be reported. Doing this check requires the results of all
the previous analyses.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="tracking-moves-and-initialization"><a class="header" href="#tracking-moves-and-initialization">Tracking moves and initialization</a></h1>
<p>Part of the borrow checker's job is to track which variables are
&quot;initialized&quot; at any given point in time -- this also requires
figuring out where moves occur and tracking those.</p>
<h2 id="initialization-and-moves"><a class="header" href="#initialization-and-moves">Initialization and moves</a></h2>
<p>From a user's perspective, initialization -- giving a variable some
value -- and moves -- transferring ownership to another place -- might
seem like distinct topics. Indeed, our borrow checker error messages
often talk about them differently. But <strong>within the borrow checker</strong>,
they are not nearly as separate. Roughly speaking, the borrow checker
tracks the set of &quot;initialized places&quot; at any point in the source
code. Assigning to a previously uninitialized local variable adds it
to that set; moving from a local variable removes it from that set.</p>
<p>Consider this example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn foo() {
    let a: Vec&lt;u32&gt;;
    
    // a is not initialized yet
    
    a = vec![22];
    
    // a is initialized here
    
    std::mem::drop(a); // a is moved here
    
    // a is no longer initialized here

    let l = a.len(); //~ ERROR
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here you can see that <code>a</code> starts off as uninitialized; once it is
assigned, it becomes initialized. But when <code>drop(a)</code> is called, that
moves <code>a</code> into the call, and hence it becomes uninitialized again.</p>
<h2 id="subsections"><a class="header" href="#subsections">Subsections</a></h2>
<p>To make it easier to peruse, this section is broken into a number of
subsections:</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="borrow_check/moves_and_initialization/move_paths.html#cross-references">Cross-references</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In reality, it's not enough to track initialization at the granularity
of local variables. Rust also allows us to do moves and initialization
at the field granularity:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn foo() {
    let a: (Vec&lt;u32&gt;, Vec&lt;u32&gt;) = (vec![22], vec![44]);

    // a.0 and a.1 are both initialized

    let b = a.0; // moves a.0

    // a.0 is not initialized, but a.1 still is

    let c = a.0; // ERROR
    let d = a.1; // OK
}
</code></pre>
<p>To handle this, we track initialization at the granularity of a <strong>move
path</strong>. A <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_dataflow/move_paths/struct.MovePath.html"><code>MovePath</code></a> represents some location that the user can
initialize, move, etc. So e.g. there is a move-path representing the
local variable <code>a</code>, and there is a move-path representing <code>a.0</code>.  Move
paths roughly correspond to the concept of a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/struct.Place.html"><code>Place</code></a> from MIR, but
they are indexed in ways that enable us to do move analysis more
efficiently.</p>
<h2 id="move-path-indices"><a class="header" href="#move-path-indices">Move path indices</a></h2>
<p>Although there is a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_dataflow/move_paths/struct.MovePath.html"><code>MovePath</code></a> data structure, they are never referenced
directly.  Instead, all the code passes around <em>indices</em> of type
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_dataflow/move_paths/struct.MovePathIndex.html"><code>MovePathIndex</code></a>. If you need to get information about a move path, you use
this index with the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_dataflow/move_paths/struct.MoveData.html#structfield.move_paths"><code>move_paths</code> field of the <code>MoveData</code></a>. For
example, to convert a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_dataflow/move_paths/struct.MovePathIndex.html"><code>MovePathIndex</code></a> <code>mpi</code> into a MIR <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/struct.Place.html"><code>Place</code></a>, you might
access the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_dataflow/move_paths/struct.MovePath.html#structfield.place"><code>MovePath::place</code></a> field like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">move_data.move_paths[mpi].place
</code></pre>
<h2 id="building-move-paths"><a class="header" href="#building-move-paths">Building move paths</a></h2>
<p>One of the first things we do in the MIR borrow check is to construct
the set of move paths. This is done as part of the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_dataflow/move_paths/struct.MoveData.html#method.gather_moves"><code>MoveData::gather_moves</code></a> function. This function uses a MIR visitor
called <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_dataflow/move_paths/builder/struct.Gatherer.html"><code>Gatherer</code></a> to walk the MIR and look at how each <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/struct.Place.html"><code>Place</code></a>
within is accessed. For each such <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/struct.Place.html"><code>Place</code></a>, it constructs a
corresponding <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_dataflow/move_paths/struct.MovePathIndex.html"><code>MovePathIndex</code></a>. It also records when/where that
particular move path is moved/initialized, but we'll get to that in a
later section.</p>
<h3 id="illegal-move-paths"><a class="header" href="#illegal-move-paths">Illegal move paths</a></h3>
<p>We don't actually create a move-path for <strong>every</strong> <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/struct.Place.html"><code>Place</code></a> that gets
used.  In particular, if it is illegal to move from a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/struct.Place.html"><code>Place</code></a>, then
there is no need for a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_dataflow/move_paths/struct.MovePathIndex.html"><code>MovePathIndex</code></a>. Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>You cannot move from a static variable, so we do not create a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_dataflow/move_paths/struct.MovePathIndex.html"><code>MovePathIndex</code></a>
for static variables.</li>
<li>You cannot move an individual element of an array, so if we have e.g. <code>foo: [String; 3]</code>,
there would be no move-path for <code>foo[1]</code>.</li>
<li>You cannot move from inside of a borrowed reference, so if we have e.g. <code>foo: &amp;String</code>,
there would be no move-path for <code>*foo</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These rules are enforced by the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_dataflow/move_paths/builder/struct.Gatherer.html#method.move_path_for"><code>move_path_for</code></a> function, which
converts a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/struct.Place.html"><code>Place</code></a> into a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_dataflow/move_paths/struct.MovePathIndex.html"><code>MovePathIndex</code></a> -- in error cases like
those just discussed, the function returns an <code>Err</code>. This in turn
means we don't have to bother tracking whether those places are
initialized (which lowers overhead).</p>
<h2 id="looking-up-a-move-path"><a class="header" href="#looking-up-a-move-path">Looking up a move-path</a></h2>
<p>If you have a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/struct.Place.html"><code>Place</code></a> and you would like to convert it to a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_dataflow/move_paths/struct.MovePathIndex.html"><code>MovePathIndex</code></a>, you
can do that using the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_dataflow/move_paths/struct.MovePathLookup.html"><code>MovePathLookup</code></a> structure found in the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_dataflow/move_paths/struct.MoveData.html#structfield.rev_lookup"><code>rev_lookup</code></a> field
of <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_dataflow/move_paths/struct.MoveData.html"><code>MoveData</code></a>. There are two different methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_dataflow/move_paths/struct.MovePathLookup.html#method.find_local"><code>find_local</code></a>, which takes a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/struct.Local.html"><code>mir::Local</code></a> representing a local
variable. This is the easier method, because we <strong>always</strong> create a
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_dataflow/move_paths/struct.MovePathIndex.html"><code>MovePathIndex</code></a> for every local variable.</li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_dataflow/move_paths/struct.MovePathLookup.html#method.find"><code>find</code></a>, which takes an arbitrary <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/struct.Place.html"><code>Place</code></a>. This method is a bit
more annoying to use, precisely because we don't have a
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_dataflow/move_paths/struct.MovePathIndex.html"><code>MovePathIndex</code></a> for <strong>every</strong> <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/struct.Place.html"><code>Place</code></a> (as we just discussed in
the &quot;illegal move paths&quot; section). Therefore, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_dataflow/move_paths/struct.MovePathLookup.html#method.find"><code>find</code></a> returns a
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_dataflow/move_paths/enum.LookupResult.html"><code>LookupResult</code></a> indicating the closest path it was able to find
that exists (e.g., for <code>foo[1]</code>, it might return just the path for
<code>foo</code>).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="cross-references"><a class="header" href="#cross-references">Cross-references</a></h2>
<p>As we noted above, move-paths are stored in a big vector and
referenced via their <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_dataflow/move_paths/struct.MovePathIndex.html"><code>MovePathIndex</code></a>. However, within this vector,
they are also structured into a tree. So for example if you have the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_dataflow/move_paths/struct.MovePathIndex.html"><code>MovePathIndex</code></a> for <code>a.b.c</code>, you can go to its parent move-path
<code>a.b</code>. You can also iterate over all children paths: so, from <code>a.b</code>,
you might iterate to find the path <code>a.b.c</code> (here you are iterating
just over the paths that are <strong>actually referenced</strong> in the source,
not all <strong>possible</strong> paths that could have been referenced). These
references are used for example in the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_dataflow/move_paths/struct.MoveData.html#method.find_in_move_path_or_its_descendants"><code>find_in_move_path_or_its_descendants</code></a> function, which determines
whether a move-path (e.g., <code>a.b</code>) or any child of that move-path
(e.g.,<code>a.b.c</code>) matches a given predicate.</p>

<p>By erasing the lifetimes in the type of <code>y</code> we no longer know that it is supposed to be <code>'static</code>,
ignoring the intentions of the user.</p>
<p>To deal with this we remember all places where the user explicitly mentioned a type during
HIR type-check as <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/struct.CanonicalUserTypeAnnotation.html"><code>CanonicalUserTypeAnnotations</code></a>.</p>
<p>There are two different annotations we care about:</p>
<ul>
<li>explicit type ascriptions, e.g. <code>let y: &amp;'static u32</code> results in <code>UserType::Ty(&amp;'static u32)</code>.</li>
<li>explicit generic arguments, e.g. <code>x.foo&lt;&amp;'a u32, Vec&lt;String&gt;&gt;</code>
results in <code>UserType::TypeOf(foo_def_id, [&amp;'a u32, Vec&lt;String&gt;])</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>As we do not want the region inference from the HIR type-check to influence MIR typeck,
we store the user type right after lowering it from the HIR.
This means that it may still contain inference variables,
which is why we are using <strong>canonical</strong> user type annotations.
We replace all inference variables with existential bound variables instead.
Something like <code>let x: Vec&lt;_&gt;</code> would therefore result in <code>exists&lt;T&gt; UserType::Ty(Vec&lt;T&gt;)</code>.</p>
<p>A pattern like <code>let Foo(x): Foo&lt;&amp;'a u32&gt;</code> has a user type <code>Foo&lt;&amp;'a u32&gt;</code> but
the actual type of <code>x</code> should only be <code>&amp;'a u32</code>. For this, we use a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/struct.UserTypeProjection.html"><code>UserTypeProjection</code></a>.</p>
<p>In the MIR, we deal with user types in two slightly different ways.</p>
<p>Given a MIR local corresponding to a variable in a pattern which has an explicit type annotation,
we require the type of that local to be equal to the type of the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/struct.UserTypeProjection.html"><code>UserTypeProjection</code></a>.
This is directly stored in the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/struct.LocalDecl.html"><code>LocalDecl</code></a>.</p>
<p>We also constrain the type of scrutinee expressions, e.g. the type of <code>x</code> in <code>let _: &amp;'a u32 = x;</code>.
Here <code>T_x</code> only has to be a subtype of the user type, so we instead use
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/enum.StatementKind.html#variant.AscribeUserType"><code>StatementKind::AscribeUserType</code></a> for that.</p>
<p>Note that we do not directly use the user type as the MIR typechecker
doesn't really deal with type and const inference variables. We instead store the final
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/struct.CanonicalUserTypeAnnotation.html#structfield.inferred_ty"><code>inferred_type</code></a> from the HIR type-checker. During MIR typeck, we then replace its regions
with new nll inference vars and relate it with the actual <code>UserType</code> to get the correct region
constraints again.</p>
<p>After the MIR type-check, all user type annotations get discarded, as they aren't needed anymore.</p>

<p>The MIR-based region checking code is located in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_borrowck/index.html">the <code>rustc_mir::borrow_check</code>
module</a>.</p>
<p>The MIR-based region analysis consists of two major functions:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_borrowck/nll/fn.replace_regions_in_mir.html"><code>replace_regions_in_mir</code></a>, invoked first, has two jobs:
<ul>
<li>First, it finds the set of regions that appear within the
signature of the function (e.g., <code>'a</code> in <code>fn foo&lt;'a&gt;(&amp;'a u32) { ... }</code>). These are called the &quot;universal&quot; or &quot;free&quot; regions – in
particular, they are the regions that <a href="borrow_check/../appendix/background.html#free-vs-bound">appear free</a> in the
function body.</li>
<li>Second, it replaces all the regions from the function body with
fresh inference variables. This is because (presently) those
regions are the results of lexical region inference and hence are
not of much interest. The intention is that – eventually – they
will be &quot;erased regions&quot; (i.e., no information at all), since we
won't be doing lexical region inference at all.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_borrowck/nll/fn.compute_regions.html"><code>compute_regions</code></a>, invoked second: this is given as argument the
results of move analysis. It has the job of computing values for all
the inference variables that <code>replace_regions_in_mir</code> introduced.
<ul>
<li>To do that, it first runs the <a href="borrow_check/./type_check.html">MIR type checker</a>. This is
basically a normal type-checker but specialized to MIR, which is
much simpler than full Rust, of course. Running the MIR type
checker will however create various <a href="borrow_check/./region_inference/constraint_propagation.html">constraints</a> between region
variables, indicating their potential values and relationships to
one another.</li>
<li>After this, we perform <a href="borrow_check/./region_inference/constraint_propagation.html">constraint propagation</a> by creating a
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_borrowck/region_infer/struct.RegionInferenceContext.html"><code>RegionInferenceContext</code></a> and invoking its <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_borrowck/region_infer/struct.RegionInferenceContext.html#method.solve"><code>solve</code></a>
method.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/2094-nll.html">NLL RFC</a> also includes fairly thorough (and hopefully readable)
coverage.</li>

<h2 id="universal-regions"><a class="header" href="#universal-regions">Universal regions</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_borrowck/universal_regions/struct.UniversalRegions.html"><code>UniversalRegions</code></a> type represents a collection of <em>universal</em> regions
corresponding to some MIR <code>DefId</code>. It is constructed in
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_borrowck/nll/fn.replace_regions_in_mir.html"><code>replace_regions_in_mir</code></a> when we replace all regions with fresh inference
variables. <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_borrowck/universal_regions/struct.UniversalRegions.html"><code>UniversalRegions</code></a> contains indices for all the free regions in
the given MIR along with any relationships that are <em>known</em> to hold between
them (e.g. implied bounds, where clauses, etc.).</p>
<p>For example, given the MIR for the following function:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>fn foo&lt;'a&gt;(x: &amp;'a u32) {
    // ...
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>we would create a universal region for <code>'a</code> and one for <code>'static</code>. There may
also be some complications for handling closures, but we will ignore those for
the moment.</p>
<p>TODO: write about <em>how</em> these regions are computed.</p>
<p><a name="region-variables"></a></p>
<h2 id="region-variables"><a class="header" href="#region-variables">Region variables</a></h2>
<p>The value of a region can be thought of as a <strong>set</strong>. This set contains all
points in the MIR where the region is valid along with any regions that are
outlived by this region (e.g. if <code>'a: 'b</code>, then <code>end('b)</code> is in the set for
<code>'a</code>); we call the domain of this set a <code>RegionElement</code>. In the code, the value
for all regions is maintained in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/compiler/rustc_borrowck/src/region_infer">the <code>rustc_borrowck::region_infer</code> module</a>.
For each region we maintain a set storing what elements are present in its value (to make this
efficient, we give each kind of element an index, the <code>RegionElementIndex</code>, and
use sparse bitsets).</p>
<p>The kinds of region elements are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each <strong><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/struct.Location.html"><code>location</code></a></strong> in the MIR control-flow graph: a location is just
the pair of a basic block and an index. This identifies the point
<strong>on entry</strong> to the statement with that index (or the terminator, if
the index is equal to <code>statements.len()</code>).</li>
<li>There is an element <code>end('a)</code> for each universal region <code>'a</code>,
corresponding to some portion of the caller's (or caller's caller,
etc) control-flow graph.</li>
<li>Similarly, there is an element denoted <code>end('static)</code> corresponding
to the remainder of program execution after this function returns.</li>
<li>There is an element <code>!1</code> for each placeholder region <code>!1</code>. This
corresponds (intuitively) to some unknown set of other elements –
for details on placeholders, see the section
<a href="borrow_check/region_inference/placeholders_and_universes.html">placeholders and universes</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="constraints-2"><a class="header" href="#constraints-2">Constraints</a></h2>
<p>Before we can infer the value of regions, we need to collect
constraints on the regions. The full set of constraints is described
in <a href="borrow_check/./region_inference/constraint_propagation.html">the section on constraint propagation</a>, but the two most
common sorts of constraints are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Outlives constraints. These are constraints that one region outlives another
(e.g. <code>'a: 'b</code>). Outlives constraints are generated by the <a href="borrow_check/./type_check.html">MIR type
checker</a>.</li>
<li>Liveness constraints. Each region needs to be live at points where it can be
used. These constraints are collected by <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_borrowck/constraint_generation/fn.generate_constraints.html"><code>generate_constraints</code></a>.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="inference-overview"><a class="header" href="#inference-overview">Inference Overview</a></h2>
<p>So how do we compute the contents of a region? This process is called <em>region
inference</em>. The high-level idea is pretty simple, but there are some details we
need to take care of.</p>
<p>Here is the high-level idea: we start off each region with the MIR locations we
know must be in it from the liveness constraints. From there, we use all of the
outlives constraints computed from the type checker to <em>propagate</em> the
constraints: for each region <code>'a</code>, if <code>'a: 'b</code>, then we add all elements of
<code>'b</code> to <code>'a</code>, including <code>end('b)</code>. This all happens in
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_borrowck/region_infer/struct.RegionInferenceContext.html#method.propagate_constraints"><code>propagate_constraints</code></a>.</p>
<p>Then, we will check for errors. We first check that type tests are satisfied by
calling <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_borrowck/region_infer/struct.RegionInferenceContext.html#method.check_type_tests"><code>check_type_tests</code></a>. This checks constraints like <code>T: 'a</code>. Second, we
check that universal regions are not &quot;too big&quot;. This is done by calling
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_borrowck/region_infer/struct.RegionInferenceContext.html#method.check_universal_regions"><code>check_universal_regions</code></a>. This checks that for each region <code>'a</code> if <code>'a</code>
contains the element <code>end('b)</code>, then we must already know that <code>'a: 'b</code> holds
(e.g. from a where clause). If we don't already know this, that is an error...
well, almost. There is some special handling for closures that we will discuss
later.</p>
<h3 id="example-1"><a class="header" href="#example-1">Example</a></h3>
<p>Consider the following example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn foo&lt;'a, 'b&gt;(x: &amp;'a usize) -&gt; &amp;'b usize {
    x
}
</code></pre>
<p>Clearly, this should not compile because we don't know if <code>'a</code> outlives <code>'b</code>
(if it doesn't then the return value could be a dangling reference).</p>
<p>Let's back up a bit. We need to introduce some free inference variables (as is
done in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_borrowck/nll/fn.replace_regions_in_mir.html"><code>replace_regions_in_mir</code></a>). This example doesn't use the exact regions
produced, but it (hopefully) is enough to get the idea across.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn foo&lt;'a, 'b&gt;(x: &amp;'a /* '#1 */ usize) -&gt; &amp;'b /* '#3 */ usize {
    x // '#2, location L1
}
</code></pre>
<p>Some notation: <code>'#1</code>, <code>'#3</code>, and <code>'#2</code> represent the universal regions for the
argument, return value, and the expression <code>x</code>, respectively. Additionally, I
will call the location of the expression <code>x</code> <code>L1</code>.</p>
<p>So now we can use the liveness constraints to get the following starting points:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Region</th><th>Contents</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>'#1</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>'#2</td><td><code>L1</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>'#3</td><td><code>L1</code></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Now we use the outlives constraints to expand each region. Specifically, we
know that <code>'#2: '#3</code> ...</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Region</th><th>Contents</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>'#1</td><td><code>L1</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>'#2</td><td><code>L1, end('#3) // add contents of '#3 and end('#3)</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>'#3</td><td><code>L1</code></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>... and <code>'#1: '#2</code>, so ...</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Region</th><th>Contents</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>'#1</td><td><code>L1, end('#2), end('#3) // add contents of '#2 and end('#2)</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>'#2</td><td><code>L1, end('#3)</code></td></tr>
<tr><td>'#3</td><td><code>L1</code></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Now, we need to check that no regions were too big (we don't have any type
tests to check in this case). Notice that <code>'#1</code> now contains <code>end('#3)</code>, but
we have no <code>where</code> clause or implied bound to say that <code>'a: 'b</code>... that's an
error!</p>
<h3 id="some-details"><a class="header" href="#some-details">Some details</a></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_borrowck/region_infer/struct.RegionInferenceContext.html"><code>RegionInferenceContext</code></a> type contains all of the information needed to
do inference, including the universal regions from <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_borrowck/nll/fn.replace_regions_in_mir.html"><code>replace_regions_in_mir</code></a> and
the constraints computed for each region. It is constructed just after we
compute the liveness constraints.</p>
<p>Here are some of the fields of the struct:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_borrowck/region_infer/struct.RegionInferenceContext.html#structfield.constraints"><code>constraints</code></a>: contains all the outlives constraints.</li>

<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_borrowck/region_infer/struct.RegionInferenceContext.html#structfield.universal_regions"><code>universal_regions</code></a>: contains the <code>UniversalRegions</code> returned by
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_borrowck/nll/fn.replace_regions_in_mir.html"><code>replace_regions_in_mir</code></a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_borrowck/region_infer/struct.RegionInferenceContext.html#structfield.universal_region_relations"><code>universal_region_relations</code></a>: contains relations known to be true about
universal regions. For example, if we have a where clause that <code>'a: 'b</code>, that
relation is assumed to be true while borrow checking the implementation (it
is checked at the caller), so <code>universal_region_relations</code> would contain <code>'a: 'b</code>.</li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_borrowck/region_infer/struct.RegionInferenceContext.html#structfield.type_tests"><code>type_tests</code></a>: contains some constraints on types that we must check after
inference (e.g. <code>T: 'a</code>).</li>

closures back out to the creator of the closure.</li>
</ul>
<p>TODO: should we discuss any of the others fields? What about the SCCs?</p>
<p>Ok, now that we have constructed a <code>RegionInferenceContext</code>, we can do
inference. This is done by calling the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_borrowck/region_infer/struct.RegionInferenceContext.html#method.solve"><code>solve</code></a> method on the context. This
is where we call <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_borrowck/region_infer/struct.RegionInferenceContext.html#method.propagate_constraints"><code>propagate_constraints</code></a> and then check the resulting type
tests and universal regions, as discussed above.</p>

<p>The main work of the region inference is <strong>constraint propagation</strong>,
which is done in the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_borrowck/region_infer/struct.RegionInferenceContext.html#method.propagate_constraints"><code>propagate_constraints</code></a> function.  There are
three sorts of constraints that are used in NLL, and we'll explain how
<code>propagate_constraints</code> works by &quot;layering&quot; those sorts of constraints
on one at a time (each of them is fairly independent from the others):</p>
<ul>
<li>liveness constraints (<code>R live at E</code>), which arise from liveness;</li>
<li>outlives constraints (<code>R1: R2</code>), which arise from subtyping;</li>
<li><a href="borrow_check/region_inference/./member_constraints.html">member constraints</a> (<code>member R_m of [R_c...]</code>), which arise from impl Trait.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this chapter, we'll explain the &quot;heart&quot; of constraint propagation,
covering both liveness and outlives constraints.</p>
<h2 id="notation-and-high-level-concepts"><a class="header" href="#notation-and-high-level-concepts">Notation and high-level concepts</a></h2>
<p>Conceptually, region inference is a &quot;fixed-point&quot; computation. It is
given some set of constraints <code>{C}</code> and it computes a set of values
<code>Values: R -&gt; {E}</code> that maps each region <code>R</code> to a set of elements
<code>{E}</code> (see <a href="borrow_check/region_inference/../region_inference.html#region-variables">here</a> for more notes on region elements):</p>
<ul>
<li>Initially, each region is mapped to an empty set, so <code>Values(R) = {}</code> for all regions <code>R</code>.</li>
<li>Next, we process the constraints repeatedly until a fixed-point is reached:
<ul>
<li>For each constraint C:
<ul>
<li>Update <code>Values</code> as needed to satisfy the constraint</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As a simple example, if we have a liveness constraint <code>R live at E</code>,
then we can apply <code>Values(R) = Values(R) union {E}</code> to make the
constraint be satisfied. Similarly, if we have an outlives constraints
<code>R1: R2</code>, we can apply <code>Values(R1) = Values(R1) union Values(R2)</code>.
(Member constraints are more complex and we discuss them <a href="borrow_check/region_inference/./member_constraints.html">in this section</a>.)</p>
<p>In practice, however, we are a bit more clever. Instead of applying
the constraints in a loop, we can analyze the constraints and figure
out the correct order to apply them, so that we only have to apply
each constraint once in order to find the final result.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the implementation, the <code>Values</code> set is stored in the
<code>scc_values</code> field, but they are indexed not by a <em>region</em> but by a
<em>strongly connected component</em> (SCC). SCCs are an optimization that
avoids a lot of redundant storage and computation.  They are explained
in the section on outlives constraints.</p>
<h2 id="liveness-constraints"><a class="header" href="#liveness-constraints">Liveness constraints</a></h2>
<p>A <strong>liveness constraint</strong> arises when some variable whose type
includes a region R is live at some <a href="borrow_check/region_inference/../../appendix/glossary.html#point">point</a> P. This simply means that
the value of R must include the point P. Liveness constraints are
computed by the MIR type checker.</p>
<p>A liveness constraint <code>R live at E</code> is satisfied if <code>E</code> is a member of
<code>Values(R)</code>. So to &quot;apply&quot; such a constraint to <code>Values</code>, we just have
to compute <code>Values(R) = Values(R) union {E}</code>.</p>
<p>The liveness values are computed in the type-check and passed to the
region inference upon creation in the <code>liveness_constraints</code> argument.
These are not represented as individual constraints like <code>R live at E</code>
though; instead, we store a (sparse) bitset per region variable (of
type <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_borrowck/region_infer/values/struct.LivenessValues.html"><code>LivenessValues</code></a>). This way we only need a single bit for each
liveness constraint.</p>
<p>One thing that is worth mentioning: All lifetime parameters are always
considered to be live over the entire function body. This is because
they correspond to some portion of the <em>caller's</em> execution, and that
execution clearly includes the time spent in this function, since the
caller is waiting for us to return.</p>
<h2 id="outlives-constraints"><a class="header" href="#outlives-constraints">Outlives constraints</a></h2>
<p>An outlives constraint <code>'a: 'b</code> indicates that the value of <code>'a</code> must
be a <strong>superset</strong> of the value of <code>'b</code>. That is, an outlives
constraint <code>R1: R2</code> is satisfied if <code>Values(R1)</code> is a superset of
<code>Values(R2)</code>. So to &quot;apply&quot; such a constraint to <code>Values</code>, we just
have to compute <code>Values(R1) = Values(R1) union Values(R2)</code>.</p>
<p>One observation that follows from this is that if you have <code>R1: R2</code>
and <code>R2: R1</code>, then <code>R1 = R2</code> must be true. Similarly, if you have:</p>
<pre><code class="language-txt">R1: R2
R2: R3
R3: R4
R4: R1
</code></pre>
<p>then <code>R1 = R2 = R3 = R4</code> follows. We take advantage of this to make things
much faster, as described shortly.</p>
<p>In the code, the set of outlives constraints is given to the region
inference context on creation in a parameter of type
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_borrowck/constraints/struct.OutlivesConstraintSet.html"><code>OutlivesConstraintSet</code></a>. The constraint set is basically just a list of <code>'a: 'b</code> constraints.</p>
<h3 id="the-outlives-constraint-graph-and-sccs"><a class="header" href="#the-outlives-constraint-graph-and-sccs">The outlives constraint graph and SCCs</a></h3>
<p>In order to work more efficiently with outlives constraints, they are
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_borrowck/constraints/struct.OutlivesConstraintSet.html#method.graph">converted into the form of a graph</a>, where the nodes of the
graph are region variables (<code>'a</code>, <code>'b</code>) and each constraint <code>'a: 'b</code>
induces an edge <code>'a -&gt; 'b</code>. This conversion happens in the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_borrowck/region_infer/struct.RegionInferenceContext.html#method.new"><code>RegionInferenceContext::new</code></a> function that creates the inference
context.</p>
<p>When using a graph representation, we can detect regions that must be equal
by looking for cycles. That is, if you have a constraint like</p>
<pre><code class="language-txt">'a: 'b
'b: 'c
'c: 'd
'd: 'a
</code></pre>
<p>then this will correspond to a cycle in the graph containing the
elements <code>'a...'d</code>.</p>
<p>Therefore, one of the first things that we do in propagating region
values is to compute the <strong>strongly connected components</strong> (SCCs) in
the constraint graph. The result is stored in the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_borrowck/region_infer/struct.RegionInferenceContext.html#structfield.constraint_sccs"><code>constraint_sccs</code></a>
field. You can then easily find the SCC that a region <code>r</code> is a part of
by invoking <code>constraint_sccs.scc(r)</code>.</p>
<p>Working in terms of SCCs allows us to be more efficient: if we have a
set of regions <code>'a...'d</code> that are part of a single SCC, we don't have
to compute/store their values separately. We can just store one value
<strong>for the SCC</strong>, since they must all be equal.</p>
<p>If you look over the region inference code, you will see that a number
of fields are defined in terms of SCCs. For example, the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_borrowck/region_infer/struct.RegionInferenceContext.html#structfield.scc_values"><code>scc_values</code></a> field stores the values of each SCC. To get the value
of a specific region <code>'a</code> then, we first figure out the SCC that the
region is a part of, and then find the value of that SCC.</p>
<p>When we compute SCCs, we not only figure out which regions are a
member of each SCC, we also figure out the edges between them. So for example
consider this set of outlives constraints:</p>
<pre><code class="language-txt">'a: 'b
'b: 'a

'a: 'c

'c: 'd
'd: 'c
</code></pre>
<p>Here we have two SCCs: S0 contains <code>'a</code> and <code>'b</code>, and S1 contains <code>'c</code>
and <code>'d</code>.  But these SCCs are not independent: because <code>'a: 'c</code>, that
means that <code>S0: S1</code> as well. That is -- the value of <code>S0</code> must be a
superset of the value of <code>S1</code>. One crucial thing is that this graph of
SCCs is always a DAG -- that is, it never has cycles. This is because
all the cycles have been removed to form the SCCs themselves.</p>
<h3 id="applying-liveness-constraints-to-sccs"><a class="header" href="#applying-liveness-constraints-to-sccs">Applying liveness constraints to SCCs</a></h3>
<p>The liveness constraints that come in from the type-checker are
expressed in terms of regions -- that is, we have a map like
<code>Liveness: R -&gt; {E}</code>.  But we want our final result to be expressed
in terms of SCCs -- we can integrate these liveness constraints very
easily just by taking the union:</p>
<pre><code class="language-txt">for each region R:
  let S be the SCC that contains R
  Values(S) = Values(S) union Liveness(R)
</code></pre>
<p>In the region inferencer, this step is done in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_borrowck/region_infer/struct.RegionInferenceContext.html#method.new"><code>RegionInferenceContext::new</code></a>.</p>
<h3 id="applying-outlives-constraints"><a class="header" href="#applying-outlives-constraints">Applying outlives constraints</a></h3>
<p>Once we have computed the DAG of SCCs, we use that to structure out
entire computation. If we have an edge <code>S1 -&gt; S2</code> between two SCCs,
that means that <code>Values(S1) &gt;= Values(S2)</code> must hold. So, to compute
the value of <code>S1</code>, we first compute the values of each successor <code>S2</code>.
Then we simply union all of those values together. To use a
quasi-iterator-like notation:</p>
<pre><code class="language-txt">Values(S1) =
  s1.successors()
    .map(|s2| Values(s2))
    .union()
</code></pre>
<p>In the code, this work starts in the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_borrowck/region_infer/struct.RegionInferenceContext.html#method.propagate_constraints"><code>propagate_constraints</code></a>
function, which iterates over all the SCCs. For each SCC <code>S1</code>, we
compute its value by first computing the value of its
successors. Since SCCs form a DAG, we don't have to be concerned about
cycles, though we do need to keep a set around to track whether we
have already processed a given SCC or not. For each successor <code>S2</code>, once
we have computed <code>S2</code>'s value, we can union those elements into the
value for <code>S1</code>. (Although we have to be careful in this process to
properly handle <a href="borrow_check/region_inference/./placeholders_and_universes.html">higher-ranked
placeholders</a>. Note that the value
for <code>S1</code> already contains the liveness constraints, since they were
added in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_borrowck/region_infer/struct.RegionInferenceContext.html#method.new"><code>RegionInferenceContext::new</code></a>.</p>
<p>Once that process is done, we now have the &quot;minimal value&quot; for <code>S1</code>,
taking into account all of the liveness and outlives
constraints. However, in order to complete the process, we must also
consider <a href="borrow_check/region_inference/./member_constraints.html">member constraints</a>, which are described in <a href="borrow_check/region_inference/./member_constraints.html">a later

</ul>
<p>&quot;Universal regions&quot; is the name that the code uses to refer to &quot;named
lifetimes&quot; -- e.g., lifetime parameters and <code>'static</code>. The name
derives from the fact that such lifetimes are &quot;universally quantified&quot;
(i.e., we must make sure the code is true for all values of those
lifetimes). It is worth spending a bit of discussing how lifetime
parameters are handled during region inference. Consider this example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn foo&lt;'a, 'b&gt;(x: &amp;'a u32, y: &amp;'b u32) -&gt; &amp;'b u32 {
  x
}
</code></pre>
<p>This example is intended not to compile, because we are returning <code>x</code>,
which has type <code>&amp;'a u32</code>, but our signature promises that we will
return a <code>&amp;'b u32</code> value. But how are lifetimes like <code>'a</code> and <code>'b</code>
integrated into region inference, and how this error wind up being
detected?</p>
<h2 id="universal-regions-and-their-relationships-to-one-another"><a class="header" href="#universal-regions-and-their-relationships-to-one-another">Universal regions and their relationships to one another</a></h2>
<p>Early on in region inference, one of the first things we do is to
construct a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_borrowck/universal_regions/struct.UniversalRegions.html"><code>UniversalRegions</code></a> struct. This struct tracks the
various universal regions in scope on a particular function.  We also
create a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_borrowck/type_check/free_region_relations/struct.UniversalRegionRelations.html"><code>UniversalRegionRelations</code></a> struct, which tracks their
relationships to one another. So if you have e.g. <code>where 'a: 'b</code>, then
the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_borrowck/type_check/free_region_relations/struct.UniversalRegionRelations.html"><code>UniversalRegionRelations</code></a> struct would track that <code>'a: 'b</code> is
known to hold (which could be tested with the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_borrowck/type_check/free_region_relations/struct.UniversalRegionRelations.html#method.outlives"><code>outlives</code></a> function.</p>
<h2 id="everything-is-a-region-variable"><a class="header" href="#everything-is-a-region-variable">Everything is a region variable</a></h2>
<p>One important aspect of how NLL region inference works is that <strong>all
lifetimes</strong> are represented as numbered variables. This means that the
only variant of <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/enum.RegionKind.html"><code>ty::RegionKind</code></a> that we use is the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/enum.RegionKind.html#variant.ReVar"><code>ReVar</code></a>
variant. These region variables are broken into two major categories,
based on their index:</p>
<ul>
<li>0..N: universal regions -- the ones we are discussing here. In this
case, the code must be correct with respect to any value of those
variables that meets the declared relationships.</li>
<li>N..M: existential regions -- inference variables where the region
inferencer is tasked with finding <em>some</em> suitable value.</li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, the universal regions can be further subdivided based on
where they were brought into scope (see the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_borrowck/universal_regions/enum.RegionClassification.html#variant.Local"><code>RegionClassification</code></a>
type). These subdivisions are not important for the topics discussed
here, but become important when we consider <a href="borrow_check/region_inference/./closure_constraints.html">closure constraint
propagation</a>, so we discuss them there.</p>
<h2 id="universal-lifetimes-as-the-elements-of-a-regions-value"><a class="header" href="#universal-lifetimes-as-the-elements-of-a-regions-value">Universal lifetimes as the elements of a region's value</a></h2>
<p>As noted previously, the value that we infer for each region is a set
<code>{E}</code>. The elements of this set can be points in the control-flow
graph, but they can also be an element <code>end('a)</code> corresponding to each
universal lifetime <code>'a</code>. If the value for some region <code>R0</code> includes
<code>end('a</code>), then this implies that <code>R0</code> must extend until the end of <code>'a</code>
in the caller.</p>
<h2 id="the-value-of-a-universal-region"><a class="header" href="#the-value-of-a-universal-region">The &quot;value&quot; of a universal region</a></h2>
<p>During region inference, we compute a value for each universal region
in the same way as we compute values for other regions. This value
represents, effectively, the <strong>lower bound</strong> on that universal region
-- the things that it must outlive. We now describe how we use this
value to check for errors.</p>
<h2 id="liveness-and-universal-regions"><a class="header" href="#liveness-and-universal-regions">Liveness and universal regions</a></h2>
<p>All universal regions have an initial liveness constraint that
includes the entire function body. This is because lifetime parameters
are defined in the caller and must include the entirety of the
function call that invokes this particular function. In addition, each
universal region <code>'a</code> includes itself (that is, <code>end('a)</code>) in its
liveness constraint (i.e., <code>'a</code> must extend until the end of
itself). In the code, these liveness constraints are setup in
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_borrowck/region_infer/struct.RegionInferenceContext.html#method.init_free_and_bound_regions"><code>init_free_and_bound_regions</code></a>.</p>
<h2 id="propagating-outlives-constraints-for-universal-regions"><a class="header" href="#propagating-outlives-constraints-for-universal-regions">Propagating outlives constraints for universal regions</a></h2>
<p>So, consider the first example of this section:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn foo&lt;'a, 'b&gt;(x: &amp;'a u32, y: &amp;'b u32) -&gt; &amp;'b u32 {
  x
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here, returning <code>x</code> requires that <code>&amp;'a u32 &lt;: &amp;'b u32</code>, which gives
rise to an outlives constraint <code>'a: 'b</code>. Combined with our default liveness
constraints we get:</p>
<pre><code class="language-txt">'a live at {B, end('a)} // B represents the &quot;function body&quot;
'b live at {B, end('b)}
'a: 'b
</code></pre>
<p>When we process the <code>'a: 'b</code> constraint, therefore, we will add
<code>end('b)</code> into the value for <code>'a</code>, resulting in a final value of <code>{B, end('a), end('b)}</code>.</p>
<h2 id="detecting-errors"><a class="header" href="#detecting-errors">Detecting errors</a></h2>
<p>Once we have finished constraint propagation, we then enforce a
constraint that if some universal region <code>'a</code> includes an element
<code>end('b)</code>, then <code>'a: 'b</code> must be declared in the function's bounds. If
not, as in our example, that is an error. This check is done in the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_borrowck/region_infer/struct.RegionInferenceContext.html#method.check_universal_regions"><code>check_universal_regions</code></a> function, which simply iterates over all
universal regions, inspects their final value, and tests against the
declared <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_borrowck/type_check/free_region_relations/struct.UniversalRegionRelations.html"><code>UniversalRegionRelations</code></a>.</p>

<p>A member constraint <code>'m member of ['c_1..'c_N]</code> expresses that the
region <code>'m</code> must be <em>equal</em> to some <strong>choice regions</strong> <code>'c_i</code> (for
some <code>i</code>). These constraints cannot be expressed by users, but they
arise from <code>impl Trait</code> due to its lifetime capture rules. Consider a
function such as the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn make(a: &amp;'a u32, b: &amp;'b u32) -&gt; impl Trait&lt;'a, 'b&gt; { .. }
</code></pre>
<p>Here, the true return type (often called the &quot;hidden type&quot;) is only
permitted to capture the lifetimes <code>'a</code> or <code>'b</code>. You can kind of see
this more clearly by desugaring that <code>impl Trait</code> return type into its
more explicit form:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">type MakeReturn&lt;'x, 'y&gt; = impl Trait&lt;'x, 'y&gt;;
fn make(a: &amp;'a u32, b: &amp;'b u32) -&gt; MakeReturn&lt;'a, 'b&gt; { .. }
</code></pre>
<p>Here, the idea is that the hidden type must be some type that could
have been written in place of the <code>impl Trait&lt;'x, 'y&gt;</code> -- but clearly
such a type can only reference the regions <code>'x</code> or <code>'y</code> (or
<code>'static</code>!), as those are the only names in scope. This limitation is
then translated into a restriction to only access <code>'a</code> or <code>'b</code> because
we are returning <code>MakeReturn&lt;'a, 'b&gt;</code>, where <code>'x</code> and <code>'y</code> have been
replaced with <code>'a</code> and <code>'b</code> respectively.</p>
<h2 id="detailed-example"><a class="header" href="#detailed-example">Detailed example</a></h2>
<p>To help us explain member constraints in more detail, let's spell out
the <code>make</code> example in a bit more detail. First off, let's assume that
you have some dummy trait:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">trait Trait&lt;'a, 'b&gt; { }
impl&lt;T&gt; Trait&lt;'_, '_&gt; for T { }
</code></pre>
<p>and this is the <code>make</code> function (in desugared form):</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">type MakeReturn&lt;'x, 'y&gt; = impl Trait&lt;'x, 'y&gt;;
fn make(a: &amp;'a u32, b: &amp;'b u32) -&gt; MakeReturn&lt;'a, 'b&gt; {
  (a, b)
}
</code></pre>
<p>What happens in this case is that the return type will be <code>(&amp;'0 u32, &amp;'1 u32)</code>,
where <code>'0</code> and <code>'1</code> are fresh region variables. We will have the following
region constraints:</p>
<pre><code class="language-txt">'0 live at {L}
'1 live at {L}
'a: '0
'b: '1
'0 member of ['a, 'b, 'static]
'1 member of ['a, 'b, 'static]
</code></pre>
<p>Here the &quot;liveness set&quot; <code>{L}</code> corresponds to that subset of the body
where <code>'0</code> and <code>'1</code> are live -- basically the point from where the
return tuple is constructed to where it is returned (in fact, <code>'0</code> and
<code>'1</code> might have slightly different liveness sets, but that's not very
interesting to the point we are illustrating here).</p>
<p>The <code>'a: '0</code> and <code>'b: '1</code> constraints arise from subtyping. When we
construct the <code>(a, b)</code> value, it will be assigned type <code>(&amp;'0 u32, &amp;'1 u32)</code> -- the region variables reflect that the lifetimes of these
references could be made smaller. For this value to be created from
<code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, however, we do require that:</p>
<pre><code class="language-txt">(&amp;'a u32, &amp;'b u32) &lt;: (&amp;'0 u32, &amp;'1 u32)
</code></pre>
<p>which means in turn that <code>&amp;'a u32 &lt;: &amp;'0 u32</code> and hence that <code>'a: '0</code>
(and similarly that <code>&amp;'b u32 &lt;: &amp;'1 u32</code>, <code>'b: '1</code>).</p>
<p>Note that if we ignore member constraints, the value of <code>'0</code> would be
inferred to some subset of the function body (from the liveness
constraints, which we did not write explicitly). It would never become
<code>'a</code>, because there is no need for it too -- we have a constraint that
<code>'a: '0</code>, but that just puts a &quot;cap&quot; on how <em>large</em> <code>'0</code> can grow to
become. Since we compute the <em>minimal</em> value that we can, we are happy
to leave <code>'0</code> as being just equal to the liveness set. This is where
member constraints come in.</p>
<h2 id="choices-are-always-lifetime-parameters"><a class="header" href="#choices-are-always-lifetime-parameters">Choices are always lifetime parameters</a></h2>
<p>At present, the &quot;choice&quot; regions from a member constraint are always lifetime
parameters from the current function. As of <!-- date-check --> October 2021,
this falls out from the placement of impl Trait, though in the future it may not
be the case. We take some advantage of this fact, as it simplifies the current
code. In particular, we don't have to consider a case like <code>'0 member of ['1, 'static]</code>, in which the value of both <code>'0</code> and <code>'1</code> are being inferred and hence
changing. See <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/61773">rust-lang/rust#61773</a> for more information.</p>
<h2 id="applying-member-constraints"><a class="header" href="#applying-member-constraints">Applying member constraints</a></h2>
<p>Member constraints are a bit more complex than other forms of
constraints. This is because they have a &quot;or&quot; quality to them -- that
is, they describe multiple choices that we must select from. E.g., in
our example constraint <code>'0 member of ['a, 'b, 'static]</code>, it might be
that <code>'0</code> is equal to <code>'a</code>, <code>'b</code>, <em>or</em> <code>'static</code>. How can we pick the
correct one?  What we currently do is to look for a <em>minimal choice</em>
-- if we find one, then we will grow <code>'0</code> to be equal to that minimal
choice. To find that minimal choice, we take two factors into
consideration: lower and upper bounds.</p>
<h3 id="lower-bounds"><a class="header" href="#lower-bounds">Lower bounds</a></h3>
<p>The <em>lower bounds</em> are those lifetimes that <code>'0</code> <em>must outlive</em> --
i.e., that <code>'0</code> must be larger than. In fact, when it comes time to
apply member constraints, we've already <em>computed</em> the lower bounds of
<code>'0</code> because we computed its minimal value (or at least, the lower
bounds considering everything but member constraints).</p>
<p>Let <code>LB</code> be the current value of <code>'0</code>. We know then that <code>'0: LB</code> must
hold, whatever the final value of <code>'0</code> is. Therefore, we can rule out
any choice <code>'choice</code> where <code>'choice: LB</code> does not hold.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in our example, this is not very helpful. The lower
bound for <code>'0</code> will just be the liveness set <code>{L}</code>, and we know that
all the lifetime parameters outlive that set. So we are left with the
same set of choices here. (But in other examples, particularly those
with different variance, lower bound constraints may be relevant.)</p>
<h3 id="upper-bounds"><a class="header" href="#upper-bounds">Upper bounds</a></h3>
<p>The <em>upper bounds</em> are those lifetimes that <em>must outlive</em> <code>'0</code> --
i.e., that <code>'0</code> must be <em>smaller</em> than. In our example, this would be
<code>'a</code>, because we have the constraint that <code>'a: '0</code>. In more complex
examples, the chain may be more indirect.</p>
<p>We can use upper bounds to rule out members in a very similar way to
lower bounds. If UB is some upper bound, then we know that <code>UB: '0</code> must hold, so we can rule out any choice <code>'choice</code> where <code>UB: 'choice</code> does not hold.</p>
<p>In our example, we would be able to reduce our choice set from <code>['a, 'b, 'static]</code> to just <code>['a]</code>. This is because <code>'0</code> has an upper bound
of <code>'a</code>, and neither <code>'a: 'b</code> nor <code>'a: 'static</code> is known to hold.</p>
<p>(For notes on how we collect upper bounds in the implementation, see
<a href="borrow_check/region_inference/member_constraints.html#collecting">the section below</a>.)</p>
<h3 id="minimal-choice"><a class="header" href="#minimal-choice">Minimal choice</a></h3>
<p>After applying lower and upper bounds, we can still sometimes have
multiple possibilities. For example, imagine a variant of our example
using types with the opposite variance. In that case, we would have
the constraint <code>'0: 'a</code> instead of <code>'a: '0</code>. Hence the current value
of <code>'0</code> would be <code>{L, 'a}</code>. Using this as a lower bound, we would be
able to narrow down the member choices to <code>['a, 'static]</code> because <code>'b: 'a</code> is not known to hold (but <code>'a: 'a</code> and <code>'static: 'a</code> do hold). We
would not have any upper bounds, so that would be our final set of choices.</p>
<p>In that case, we apply the <strong>minimal choice</strong> rule -- basically, if
one of our choices if smaller than the others, we can use that. In
this case, we would opt for <code>'a</code> (and not <code>'static</code>).</p>
<p>This choice is consistent with the general 'flow' of region
propagation, which always aims to compute a minimal value for the
region being inferred. However, it is somewhat arbitrary.</p>
<p><a name="collecting"></a></p>
<h3 id="collecting-upper-bounds-in-the-implementation"><a class="header" href="#collecting-upper-bounds-in-the-implementation">Collecting upper bounds in the implementation</a></h3>
<p>In practice, computing upper bounds is a bit inconvenient, because our
data structures are setup for the opposite. What we do is to compute
the <strong>reverse SCC graph</strong> (we do this lazily and cache the result) --
that is, a graph where <code>'a: 'b</code> induces an edge <code>SCC('b) -&gt; SCC('a)</code>. Like the normal SCC graph, this is a DAG. We can then do a
depth-first search starting from <code>SCC('0)</code> in this graph. This will
take us to all the SCCs that must outlive <code>'0</code>.</p>
<p>One wrinkle is that, as we walk the &quot;upper bound&quot; SCCs, their values
will not yet have been fully computed. However, we <strong>have</strong> already
applied their liveness constraints, so we have some information about
their value. In particular, for any regions representing lifetime
parameters, their value will contain themselves (i.e., the initial
value for <code>'a</code> includes <code>'a</code> and the value for <code>'b</code> contains <code>'b</code>). So
we can collect all of the lifetime parameters that are reachable,
which is precisely what we are interested in.</p>

<p>This program ought not to type-check: <code>foo</code> needs a static reference

accepts <strong>any</strong> reference (so it can call it with something on its
stack, for example). But <em>how</em> do we reject it and <em>why</em>?</p>
<h2 id="subtyping-and-placeholders"><a class="header" href="#subtyping-and-placeholders">Subtyping and Placeholders</a></h2>
<p>When we type-check <code>main</code>, and in particular the call <code>bar(foo)</code>, we
are going to wind up with a subtyping relationship like this one:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">fn(&amp;'static u32) &lt;: for&lt;'a&gt; fn(&amp;'a u32)
----------------    -------------------
the type of `foo`   the type `bar` expects
</code></pre>
<p>We handle this sort of subtyping by taking the variables that are
bound in the supertype and replacing them with
<a href="borrow_check/region_inference/../../appendix/background.html#quantified">universally quantified</a>
representatives, denoted like <code>!1</code> here. We call these regions &quot;placeholder
regions&quot; – they represent, basically, &quot;some unknown region&quot;.</p>
<p>Once we've done that replacement, we have the following relation:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">fn(&amp;'static u32) &lt;: fn(&amp;'!1 u32)
</code></pre>
<p>The key idea here is that this unknown region <code>'!1</code> is not related to
any other regions. So if we can prove that the subtyping relationship
is true for <code>'!1</code>, then it ought to be true for any region, which is
what we wanted.</p>
<p>So let's work through what happens next. To check if two functions are
subtypes, we check if their arguments have the desired relationship
(fn arguments are <a href="borrow_check/region_inference/../../appendix/background.html#variance">contravariant</a>, so
we swap the left and right here):</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">&amp;'!1 u32 &lt;: &amp;'static u32
</code></pre>
<p>According to the basic subtyping rules for a reference, this will be
true if <code>'!1: 'static</code>. That is – if &quot;some unknown region <code>!1</code>&quot; outlives <code>'static</code>.
Now, this <em>might</em> be true – after all, <code>'!1</code> could be <code>'static</code> –
but we don't <em>know</em> that it's true. So this should yield up an error (eventually).</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-universe"><a class="header" href="#what-is-a-universe">What is a universe?</a></h2>
<p>In the previous section, we introduced the idea of a placeholder
region, and we denoted it <code>!1</code>. We call this number <code>1</code> the <strong>universe
index</strong>. The idea of a &quot;universe&quot; is that it is a set of names that
are in scope within some type or at some point. Universes are formed
into a tree, where each child extends its parents with some new names.
So the <strong>root universe</strong> conceptually contains global names, such as
the lifetime <code>'static</code> or the type <code>i32</code>. In the compiler, we also
put generic type parameters into this root universe (in this sense,
there is not just one root universe, but one per item). So consider
this function <code>bar</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">struct Foo { }

fn bar&lt;'a, T&gt;(t: &amp;'a T) {
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here, the root universe would consist of the lifetimes <code>'static</code> and
<code>'a</code>.  In fact, although we're focused on lifetimes here, we can apply
the same concept to types, in which case the types <code>Foo</code> and <code>T</code> would
be in the root universe (along with other global types, like <code>i32</code>).
Basically, the root universe contains all the names that
<a href="borrow_check/region_inference/../../appendix/background.html#free-vs-bound">appear free</a> in the body of <code>bar</code>.</p>
<p>Now let's extend <code>bar</code> a bit by adding a variable <code>x</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn bar&lt;'a, T&gt;(t: &amp;'a T) {
    let x: for&lt;'b&gt; fn(&amp;'b u32) = ...;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here, the name <code>'b</code> is not part of the root universe. Instead, when we
&quot;enter&quot; into this <code>for&lt;'b&gt;</code> (e.g., by replacing it with a placeholder), we will create
a child universe of the root, let's call it U1:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">U0 (root universe)
│
└─ U1 (child universe)
</code></pre>
<p>The idea is that this child universe U1 extends the root universe U0
with a new name, which we are identifying by its universe number:
<code>!1</code>.</p>
<p>Now let's extend <code>bar</code> a bit by adding one more variable, <code>y</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn bar&lt;'a, T&gt;(t: &amp;'a T) {
    let x: for&lt;'b&gt; fn(&amp;'b u32) = ...;
    let y: for&lt;'c&gt; fn(&amp;'c u32) = ...;
}
</code></pre>
<p>When we enter <em>this</em> type, we will again create a new universe, which
we'll call <code>U2</code>. Its parent will be the root universe, and U1 will be
its sibling:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">U0 (root universe)
│
├─ U1 (child universe)
│
└─ U2 (child universe)
</code></pre>
<p>This implies that, while in U2, we can name things from U0 or U2, but
not U1.</p>
<p><strong>Giving existential variables a universe.</strong> Now that we have this
notion of universes, we can use it to extend our type-checker and
things to prevent illegal names from leaking out. The idea is that we
give each inference (existential) variable – whether it be a type or
a lifetime – a universe. That variable's value can then only
reference names visible from that universe. So for example if a
lifetime variable is created in U0, then it cannot be assigned a value
of <code>!1</code> or <code>!2</code>, because those names are not visible from the universe
U0.</p>
<p><strong>Representing universes with just a counter.</strong> You might be surprised
to see that the compiler doesn't keep track of a full tree of
universes. Instead, it just keeps a counter – and, to determine if
one universe can see another one, it just checks if the index is
greater. For example, U2 can see U0 because 2 &gt;= 0. But U0 cannot see
U2, because 0 &gt;= 2 is false.</p>
<p>How can we get away with this? Doesn't this mean that we would allow
U2 to also see U1? The answer is that, yes, we would, <strong>if that
question ever arose</strong>.  But because of the structure of our type
checker etc, there is no way for that to happen. In order for
something happening in the universe U1 to &quot;communicate&quot; with something
happening in U2, they would have to have a shared inference variable X
in common. And because everything in U1 is scoped to just U1 and its
children, that inference variable X would have to be in U0. And since
X is in U0, it cannot name anything from U1 (or U2). This is perhaps easiest
to see by using a kind of generic &quot;logic&quot; example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">exists&lt;X&gt; {
   forall&lt;Y&gt; { ... /* Y is in U1 ... */ }
   forall&lt;Z&gt; { ... /* Z is in U2 ... */ }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here, the only way for the two foralls to interact would be through X,
but neither Y nor Z are in scope when X is declared, so its value
cannot reference either of them.</p>
<h2 id="universes-and-placeholder-region-elements"><a class="header" href="#universes-and-placeholder-region-elements">Universes and placeholder region elements</a></h2>
<p>But where does that error come from?  The way it happens is like this.
When we are constructing the region inference context, we can tell
from the type inference context how many placeholder variables exist
(the <code>InferCtxt</code> has an internal counter). For each of those, we
create a corresponding universal region variable <code>!n</code> and a &quot;region
element&quot; <code>placeholder(n)</code>. This corresponds to &quot;some unknown set of other
elements&quot;. The value of <code>!n</code> is <code>{placeholder(n)}</code>.</p>
<p>At the same time, we also give each existential variable a
<strong>universe</strong> (also taken from the <code>InferCtxt</code>). This universe
determines which placeholder elements may appear in its value: For
example, a variable in universe U3 may name <code>placeholder(1)</code>, <code>placeholder(2)</code>, and
<code>placeholder(3)</code>, but not <code>placeholder(4)</code>. Note that the universe of an inference
variable controls what region elements <strong>can</strong> appear in its value; it
does not say region elements <strong>will</strong> appear.</p>
<h2 id="placeholders-and-outlives-constraints"><a class="header" href="#placeholders-and-outlives-constraints">Placeholders and outlives constraints</a></h2>
<p>In the region inference engine, outlives constraints have the form:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">V1: V2 @ P
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>V1</code> and <code>V2</code> are region indices, and hence map to some region
variable (which may be universally or existentially quantified). The
<code>P</code> here is a &quot;point&quot; in the control-flow graph; it's not important
for this section. This variable will have a universe, so let's call
those universes <code>U(V1)</code> and <code>U(V2)</code> respectively. (Actually, the only
one we are going to care about is <code>U(V1)</code>.)</p>
<p>When we encounter this constraint, the ordinary procedure is to start
a DFS from <code>P</code>. We keep walking so long as the nodes we are walking
are present in <code>value(V2)</code> and we add those nodes to <code>value(V1)</code>. If
we reach a return point, we add in any <code>end(X)</code> elements. That part
remains unchanged.</p>
<p>But then <em>after that</em> we want to iterate over the placeholder <code>placeholder(x)</code>
elements in V2 (each of those must be visible to <code>U(V2)</code>, but we
should be able to just assume that is true, we don't have to check
it). We have to ensure that <code>value(V1)</code> outlives each of those
placeholder elements.</p>
<p>Now there are two ways that could happen. First, if <code>U(V1)</code> can see
the universe <code>x</code> (i.e., <code>x &lt;= U(V1)</code>), then we can just add <code>placeholder(x)</code>
to <code>value(V1)</code> and be done. But if not, then we have to approximate:
we may not know what set of elements <code>placeholder(x)</code> represents, but we
should be able to compute some sort of <strong>upper bound</strong> B for it –
some region B that outlives <code>placeholder(x)</code>. For now, we'll just use
<code>'static</code> for that (since it outlives everything) – in the future, we
can sometimes be smarter here (and in fact we have code for doing this
already in other contexts). Moreover, since <code>'static</code> is in the root
universe U0, we know that all variables can see it – so basically if
we find that <code>value(V2)</code> contains <code>placeholder(x)</code> for some universe <code>x</code>
that <code>V1</code> can't see, then we force <code>V1</code> to <code>'static</code>.</p>
<h2 id="extending-the-universal-regions-check"><a class="header" href="#extending-the-universal-regions-check">Extending the &quot;universal regions&quot; check</a></h2>
<p>After all constraints have been propagated, the NLL region inference
has one final check, where it goes over the values that wound up being
computed for each universal region and checks that they did not get
'too large'. In our case, we will go through each placeholder region
and check that it contains <em>only</em> the <code>placeholder(u)</code> element it is known to
outlive. (Later, we might be able to know that there are relationships
between two placeholder regions and take those into account, as we do
for universal regions from the fn signature.)</p>
<p>Put another way, the &quot;universal regions&quot; check can be considered to be
checking constraints like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">{placeholder(1)}: V1
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>{placeholder(1)}</code> is like a constant set, and V1 is the variable we
made to represent the <code>!1</code> region.</p>
<h2 id="back-to-our-example"><a class="header" href="#back-to-our-example">Back to our example</a></h2>
<p>OK, so far so good. Now let's walk through what would happen with our
first example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">fn(&amp;'static u32) &lt;: fn(&amp;'!1 u32) @ P  // this point P is not imp't here
</code></pre>
<p>The region inference engine will create a region element domain like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">{ CFG; end('static); placeholder(1) }
  ---  ------------  ------- from the universe `!1`
  |    'static is always in scope
  all points in the CFG; not especially relevant here
</code></pre>
<p>It will always create two universal variables, one representing
<code>'static</code> and one representing <code>'!1</code>. Let's call them Vs and V1. They
will have initial values like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Vs = { CFG; end('static) } // it is in U0, so can't name anything else
V1 = { placeholder(1) }
</code></pre>
<p>From the subtyping constraint above, we would have an outlives constraint like</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">'!1: 'static @ P
</code></pre>
<p>To process this, we would grow the value of V1 to include all of Vs:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Vs = { CFG; end('static) }
V1 = { CFG; end('static), placeholder(1) }
</code></pre>
<p>At that point, constraint propagation is complete, because all the
outlives relationships are satisfied. Then we would go to the &quot;check
universal regions&quot; portion of the code, which would test that no
universal region grew too large.</p>
<p>In this case, <code>V1</code> <em>did</em> grow too large – it is not known to outlive
<code>end('static)</code>, nor any of the CFG – so we would report an error.</p>
<h2 id="another-example"><a class="header" href="#another-example">Another example</a></h2>
<p>What about this subtyping relationship?</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">for&lt;'a&gt; fn(&amp;'a u32, &amp;'a u32)
    &lt;:
for&lt;'b, 'c&gt; fn(&amp;'b u32, &amp;'c u32)
</code></pre>
<p>Here we would replace the bound region in the supertype with a placeholder, as before, yielding:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">for&lt;'a&gt; fn(&amp;'a u32, &amp;'a u32)
    &lt;:
fn(&amp;'!1 u32, &amp;'!2 u32)
</code></pre>
<p>then we instantiate the variable on the left-hand side with an
existential in universe U2, yielding the following (<code>?n</code> is a notation
for an existential variable):</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">fn(&amp;'?3 u32, &amp;'?3 u32)
    &lt;:
fn(&amp;'!1 u32, &amp;'!2 u32)
</code></pre>
<p>Then we break this down further:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">&amp;'!1 u32 &lt;: &amp;'?3 u32
&amp;'!2 u32 &lt;: &amp;'?3 u32
</code></pre>
<p>and even further, yield up our region constraints:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">'!1: '?3
'!2: '?3
</code></pre>
<p>Note that, in this case, both <code>'!1</code> and <code>'!2</code> have to outlive the
variable <code>'?3</code>, but the variable <code>'?3</code> is not forced to outlive
anything else. Therefore, it simply starts and ends as the empty set
of elements, and hence the type-check succeeds here.</p>
<p>(This should surprise you a little. It surprised me when I first realized it.
We are saying that if we are a fn that <strong>needs both of its arguments to have
the same region</strong>, we can accept being called with <strong>arguments with two
distinct regions</strong>. That seems intuitively unsound. But in fact, it's fine, as
I tried to explain in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/32330#issuecomment-202536977">this issue</a> on the Rust issue
tracker long ago.  The reason is that even if we get called with arguments of
two distinct lifetimes, those two lifetimes have some intersection (the call
itself), and that intersection can be our value of <code>'a</code> that we use as the
common lifetime of our arguments. -nmatsakis)</p>
<h2 id="final-example"><a class="header" href="#final-example">Final example</a></h2>
<p>Let's look at one last example. We'll extend the previous one to have
a return type:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">for&lt;'a&gt; fn(&amp;'a u32, &amp;'a u32) -&gt; &amp;'a u32
    &lt;:
for&lt;'b, 'c&gt; fn(&amp;'b u32, &amp;'c u32) -&gt; &amp;'b u32
</code></pre>
<p>Despite seeming very similar to the previous example, this case is going to get
an error. That's good: the problem is that we've gone from a fn that promises
to return one of its two arguments, to a fn that is promising to return the
first one. That is unsound. Let's see how it plays out.</p>
<p>First, we replace the bound region in the supertype with a placeholder:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">for&lt;'a&gt; fn(&amp;'a u32, &amp;'a u32) -&gt; &amp;'a u32
    &lt;:
fn(&amp;'!1 u32, &amp;'!2 u32) -&gt; &amp;'!1 u32
</code></pre>
<p>Then we instantiate the subtype with existentials (in U2):</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">fn(&amp;'?3 u32, &amp;'?3 u32) -&gt; &amp;'?3 u32
    &lt;:
fn(&amp;'!1 u32, &amp;'!2 u32) -&gt; &amp;'!1 u32
</code></pre>
<p>And now we create the subtyping relationships:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">&amp;'!1 u32 &lt;: &amp;'?3 u32 // arg 1
&amp;'!2 u32 &lt;: &amp;'?3 u32 // arg 2
&amp;'?3 u32 &lt;: &amp;'!1 u32 // return type
</code></pre>
<p>And finally the outlives relationships. Here, let V1, V2, and V3 be the
variables we assign to <code>!1</code>, <code>!2</code>, and <code>?3</code> respectively:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">V1: V3
V2: V3
V3: V1
</code></pre>
<p>Those variables will have these initial values:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">V1 in U1 = {placeholder(1)}
V2 in U2 = {placeholder(2)}
V3 in U2 = {}
</code></pre>
<p>Now because of the <code>V3: V1</code> constraint, we have to add <code>placeholder(1)</code> into <code>V3</code> (and
indeed it is visible from <code>V3</code>), so we get:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">V3 in U2 = {placeholder(1)}
</code></pre>
<p>then we have this constraint <code>V2: V3</code>, so we wind up having to enlarge
<code>V2</code> to include <code>placeholder(1)</code> (which it can also see):</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">V2 in U2 = {placeholder(1), placeholder(2)}
</code></pre>
<p>Now constraint propagation is done, but when we check the outlives
relationships, we find that <code>V2</code> includes this new element <code>placeholder(1)</code>,
so we report an error.</p>

<p>When we are checking the type tests and universal regions, we may come
across a constraint that we can't prove yet if we are in a closure
body! However, the necessary constraints may actually hold (we just
don't know it yet). Thus, if we are inside a closure, we just collect
all the constraints we can't prove yet and return them. Later, when we
are borrow check the MIR node that created the closure, we can also
check that these constraints hold. At that time, if we can't prove
they hold, we report an error.</p>

<p>Two-phase borrows are a more permissive version of mutable borrows that allow

<p>Only certain implicit mutable borrows can be two-phase, any <code>&amp;mut</code> or <code>ref mut</code>

<li>The autoref borrow when calling a method with a mutable reference receiver.</li>
<li>A mutable reborrow in function arguments.</li>
<li>The implicit mutable borrow in an overloaded compound assignment operator.</li>

<p>Whether a borrow can be two-phase is tracked by a flag on the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/adjustment/enum.AutoBorrow.html"><code>AutoBorrow</code></a>

<p>Each two-phase borrow is assigned to a temporary that is only used once. As
such we can define:</p>
<ul>
<li>The point where the temporary is assigned to is called the <em>reservation</em>

<li>The point where the temporary is used, which is effectively always a

<p>The activation points are found using the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/visit/trait.Visitor.html#method.visit_local"><code>GatherBorrows</code></a> visitor. The

<p>When working with associated and/or generic items (types, constants,
functions/methods) it is often relevant to have more information about the
<code>Self</code> or generic parameters. Trait bounds and similar information is encoded in
the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/struct.ParamEnv.html"><code>ParamEnv</code></a>. Often this is not enough information to obtain things like the
type's <code>Layout</code>, but you can do all kinds of other checks on it (e.g. whether a
type implements <code>Copy</code>) or you can evaluate an associated constant whose value
does not depend on anything from the parameter environment.</p>
<p>For example if you have a function</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]

<p>the parameter environment for that function is <code>[T: Copy]</code>. This means any

its <code>Copy</code> bound via the parameter environment.</p>
<p>You can get the parameter environment for a <code>def_id</code> using the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_ty_utils/ty/fn.param_env.html"><code>param_env</code></a> query. However, this <code>ParamEnv</code> can be too generic for
your use case. Using the <code>ParamEnv</code> from the surrounding context can allow you
to evaluate more things. For example, suppose we had something the following:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>trait Foo {
    type Assoc;
}

trait Bar { }

trait Baz {
    fn stuff() -&gt; bool;
}

fn foo&lt;T&gt;(t: T)
where
    T: Foo,
    &lt;T as Foo&gt;::Assoc: Bar
{
   bar::&lt;T::Assoc&gt;()
}

fn bar&lt;T: Baz&gt;() {
    if T::stuff() { mep() } else { mop() }
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>We may know some things inside <code>bar</code> that we wouldn't know if we just fetched
<code>bar</code>'s param env because of the <code>&lt;T as Foo&gt;::Assoc: Bar</code> bound in <code>foo</code>. This
is a contrived example that makes no sense in our existing analyses, but we may
run into similar cases when doing analyses with associated constants on generic
traits or traits with assoc types.</p>
<h2 id="bundling"><a class="header" href="#bundling">Bundling</a></h2>
<p>Another great thing about <code>ParamEnv</code> is that you can use it to bundle the thing
depending on generic parameters (e.g. a <code>Ty</code>) by calling the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/struct.ParamEnv.html#method.and"><code>and</code></a>
method. This will produce a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/struct.ParamEnvAnd.html"><code>ParamEnvAnd&lt;Ty&gt;</code></a>, making clear that you
should probably not be using the inner value without taking care to also use
the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/struct.ParamEnv.html"><code>ParamEnv</code></a>.</p>

<p>A lot of effort has been put into making <code>rustc</code> have great error messages.
This chapter is about how to emit compile errors and lints from the compiler.</p>
<h2 id="diagnostic-structure"><a class="header" href="#diagnostic-structure">Diagnostic structure</a></h2>
<p>The main parts of a diagnostic error are the following:</p>
<pre><code>error[E0000]: main error message
  --&gt; file.rs:LL:CC
   |
LL | &lt;code&gt;
   | -^^^^- secondary label
   |  |
   |  primary label
   |
   = note: note without a `Span`, created with `.note`
note: sub-diagnostic message for `.span_note`
  --&gt; file.rs:LL:CC
   |
LL | more code
   |      ^^^^
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Level (<code>error</code>, <code>warning</code>, etc.). It indicates the severity of the message.
(See <a href="diagnostics.html#diagnostic-levels">diagnostic levels</a>)</li>
<li>Code (for example, for &quot;mismatched types&quot;, it is <code>E0308</code>). It helps
users get more information about the current error through an extended
description of the problem in the error code index. Diagnostics created
by lints don't have a code in the emitted message.</li>
<li>Message. It is the main description of the problem. It should be general and
able to stand on its own, so that it can make sense even in isolation.</li>
<li>Diagnostic window. This contains several things:
<ul>
<li>The path, line number and column of the beginning of the primary span.</li>
<li>The users' affected code and its surroundings.</li>
<li>Primary and secondary spans underlying the users' code. These spans can
optionally contain one or more labels.
<ul>
<li>Primary spans should have enough text to describe the problem in such a
way that if it were the only thing being displayed (for example, in an
IDE) it would still make sense. Because it is &quot;spatially aware&quot; (it
points at the code), it can generally be more succinct than the error
message.</li>
<li>If cluttered output can be foreseen in cases when multiple span labels
overlap, it is a good idea to tweak the output appropriately. For
example, the <code>if/else arms have incompatible types</code> error uses different
spans depending on whether the arms are all in the same line, if one of
the arms is empty and if none of those cases applies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sub-diagnostics. Any error can have multiple sub-diagnostics that look
similar to the main part of the error. These are used for cases where the
order of the explanation might not correspond with the order of the code. If
the order of the explanation can be &quot;order free&quot;, leveraging secondary labels
in the main diagnostic is preferred, as it is typically less verbose.</li>
</ul>
<p>The text should be matter of fact and avoid capitalization and periods, unless
multiple sentences are <em>needed</em>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-txt">error: the fobrulator needs to be krontrificated
</code></pre>
<p>When code or an identifier must appear in a message or label, it should be
surrounded with backticks:</p>
<pre><code class="language-txt">error: the identifier `foo.bar` is invalid
</code></pre>
<h3 id="error-explanations"><a class="header" href="#error-explanations">Error explanations</a></h3>
<p>Some errors include long form descriptions. They may be viewed with the
<code>--explain</code> flag, or via the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/error-index.html">error index</a>. Each explanation comes with an
example of how to trigger it and advice on how to fix it.</p>
<p>Please read <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1567-long-error-codes-explanation-normalization.md">RFC 1567</a> for details on how to format and write long error
codes.</p>
<p>The descriptions are written in Markdown, and all of them are linked in the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_error_codes/error_codes/index.html"><code>rustc_error_codes</code></a> crate.</p>
<p>As a general rule, give an error a code (with an associated explanation) if the
explanation would give more information than the error itself. A lot of the time
it's better to put all the information in the emitted error itself. However,
sometimes that would make the error verbose or there are too many possible
triggers to include useful information for all cases in the error, in which case
it's a good idea to add an explanation.<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#estebank">1</a></sup>
As always, if you are not sure, just ask your reviewer!</p>

<h3 id="lints-versus-fixed-diagnostics"><a class="header" href="#lints-versus-fixed-diagnostics">Lints versus fixed diagnostics</a></h3>
<p>Some messages are emitted via <a href="diagnostics.html#lints">lints</a>, where the user can control the
level. Most diagnostics are hard-coded such that the user cannot control the
level.</p>
<p>Usually it is obvious whether a diagnostic should be &quot;fixed&quot; or a lint, but
there are some grey areas.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Borrow checker errors: these are fixed errors. The user cannot adjust the
level of these diagnostics to silence the borrow checker.</li>
<li>Dead code: this is a lint. While the user probably doesn't want dead code in
their crate, making this a hard error would make refactoring and development
very painful.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/46043">safe_packed_borrows future compatibility warning</a>:
this is a silencable lint related to safety. It was judged that the making
this a hard (fixed) error would cause too much breakage, so instead a
warning is emitted that eventually will be turned into a hard error.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hard-coded warnings (those using the <code>span_warn</code> methods) should be avoided
for normal code, preferring to use lints instead. Some cases, such as warnings
with CLI flags, will require the use of hard-coded warnings.</p>
<p>See the <code>deny</code> <a href="diagnostics.html#diagnostic-levels">lint level</a> below for guidelines when to
use an error-level lint instead of a fixed error.</p>
<h2 id="diagnostic-output-style-guide"><a class="header" href="#diagnostic-output-style-guide">Diagnostic output style guide</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Write in plain simple English. If your message, when shown on a – possibly
small – screen (which hasn't been cleaned for a while), cannot be understood
by a normal programmer, who just came out of bed after a night partying,
it's too complex.</li>
<li><code>Error</code>, <code>Warning</code>, <code>Note</code>, and <code>Help</code> messages start with a lowercase
letter and do not end with punctuation.</li>
<li>Error messages should be succinct. Users will see these error messages many
times, and more verbose descriptions can be viewed with the <code>--explain</code>
flag. That said, don't make it so terse that it's hard to understand.</li>
<li>The word &quot;illegal&quot; is illegal. Prefer &quot;invalid&quot; or a more specific word
instead.</li>
<li>Errors should document the span of code where they occur (use
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_errors/diagnostic_builder/struct.DiagnosticBuilder.html"><code>rustc_errors::diagnostic_builder::DiagnosticBuilder</code></a>'s
<code>span_*</code> methods or a diagnostic struct's <code>#[primary_span]</code> to easily do
this). Also <code>note</code> other spans that have contributed to the error if the span
isn't too large.</li>
<li>When emitting a message with span, try to reduce the span to the smallest
amount possible that still signifies the issue</li>
<li>Try not to emit multiple error messages for the same error. This may require
detecting duplicates.</li>
<li>When the compiler has too little information for a specific error message,
consult with the compiler team to add new attributes for library code that
allow adding more information. For example see
<a href="diagnostics.html#rustc_on_unimplemented"><code>#[rustc_on_unimplemented]</code></a>. Use these
annotations when available!</li>
<li>Keep in mind that Rust's learning curve is rather steep, and that the
compiler messages are an important learning tool.</li>
<li>When talking about the compiler, call it <code>the compiler</code>, not <code>Rust</code> or
<code>rustc</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="lint-naming"><a class="header" href="#lint-naming">Lint naming</a></h3>
<p>From <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/0344-conventions-galore.md#lints">RFC 0344</a>, lint names should be consistent, with the following
guidelines:</p>
<p>The basic rule is: the lint name should make sense when read as &quot;allow
<em>lint-name</em>&quot; or &quot;allow <em>lint-name</em> items&quot;. For example, &quot;allow
<code>deprecated</code> items&quot; and &quot;allow <code>dead_code</code>&quot; makes sense, while &quot;allow
<code>unsafe_block</code>&quot; is ungrammatical (should be plural).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lint names should state the bad thing being checked for, e.g. <code>deprecated</code>,
so that <code>#[allow(deprecated)]</code> (items) reads correctly. Thus <code>ctypes</code> is not
an appropriate name; <code>improper_ctypes</code> is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lints that apply to arbitrary items (like the stability lints) should just
mention what they check for: use <code>deprecated</code> rather than
<code>deprecated_items</code>. This keeps lint names short. (Again, think &quot;allow
<em>lint-name</em> items&quot;.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a lint applies to a specific grammatical class, mention that class and
use the plural form: use <code>unused_variables</code> rather than <code>unused_variable</code>.
This makes <code>#[allow(unused_variables)]</code> read correctly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lints that catch unnecessary, unused, or useless aspects of code should use
the term <code>unused</code>, e.g. <code>unused_imports</code>, <code>unused_typecasts</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use snake case in the same way you would for function names.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="diagnostic-levels"><a class="header" href="#diagnostic-levels">Diagnostic levels</a></h3>
<p>Guidelines for different diagnostic levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>error</code>: emitted when the compiler detects a problem that makes it unable to
compile the program, either because the program is invalid or the programmer
has decided to make a specific <code>warning</code> into an error.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>warning</code>: emitted when the compiler detects something odd about a program.
Care should be taken when adding warnings to avoid warning fatigue, and
avoid false-positives where there really isn't a problem with the code. Some
examples of when it is appropriate to issue a warning:</p>
<ul>
<li>A situation where the user <em>should</em> take action, such as swap out a
deprecated item, or use a <code>Result</code>, but otherwise doesn't prevent
compilation.</li>
<li>Unnecessary syntax that can be removed without affecting the semantics of
the code. For example, unused code, or unnecessary <code>unsafe</code>.</li>
<li>Code that is very likely to be incorrect, dangerous, or confusing, but the
language technically allows, and is not ready or confident enough to make
an error. For example <code>unused_comparisons</code> (out of bounds comparisons) or
<code>bindings_with_variant_name</code> (the user likely did not intend to create a
binding in a pattern).</li>
<li><a href="diagnostics.html#future-incompatible">Future-incompatible lints</a>, where something was
accidentally or erroneously accepted in the past, but rejecting would
cause excessive breakage in the ecosystem.</li>
<li>Stylistic choices. For example, camel or snake case, or the <code>dyn</code> trait
warning in the 2018 edition. These have a high bar to be added, and should
only be used in exceptional circumstances. Other stylistic choices should
either be allow-by-default lints, or part of other tools like Clippy or
rustfmt.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>help</code>: emitted following an <code>error</code> or <code>warning</code> to give additional
information to the user about how to solve their problem. These messages
often include a suggestion string and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_errors/enum.Applicability.html"><code>rustc_errors::Applicability</code></a>
confidence level to guide automated source fixes by tools. See the
<a href="diagnostics.html#suggestions">Suggestions</a> section for more details.</p>
<p>The error or warning portion should <em>not</em> suggest how to fix the problem,
only the &quot;help&quot; sub-diagnostic should.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>note</code>: emitted to given more context and identify additional circumstances
and parts of the code that caused the warning or error. For example, the
borrow checker will note any previous conflicting borrows.</p>
<p><code>help</code> vs <code>note</code>: <code>help</code> should be used to show changes the user can
possibly make to fix the problem. <code>note</code> should be used for everything else,
such as other context, information and facts, online resources to read, etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Not to be confused with <em>lint levels</em>, whose guidelines are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>forbid</code>: Lints should never default to <code>forbid</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>deny</code>: Equivalent to <code>error</code> diagnostic level. Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>A future-incompatible or edition-based lint that has graduated from the
warning level.</li>
<li>Something that has an extremely high confidence that is incorrect, but
still want an escape hatch to allow it to pass.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>warn</code>: Equivalent to the <code>warning</code> diagnostic level. See <code>warning</code> above
for guidelines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>allow</code>: Examples of the kinds of lints that should default to <code>allow</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The lint has a too high false positive rate.</li>
<li>The lint is too opinionated.</li>
<li>The lint is experimental.</li>
<li>The lint is used for enforcing something that is not normally enforced.
For example, the <code>unsafe_code</code> lint can be used to prevent usage of unsafe
code.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="finding-the-source-of-errors"><a class="header" href="#finding-the-source-of-errors">Finding the source of errors</a></h3>
<p>There are three main ways to find where a given error is emitted:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>grep</code> for either a sub-part of the error message/label or error code. This
usually works well and is straightforward, but there are some cases where
the code emitting the error is removed from the code where the error is
constructed behind a relatively deep call-stack. Even then, it is a good way
to get your bearings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invoking <code>rustc</code> with the nightly-only flag <code>-Z treat-err-as-bug=1</code>
will treat the first error being emitted as an Internal Compiler Error, which
allows you to get a
stack trace at the point the error has been emitted. Change the <code>1</code> to
something else if you wish to trigger on a later error.</p>
<p>There are limitations with this approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some calls get elided from the stack trace because they get inlined in the compiled <code>rustc</code>.</li>
<li>The <em>construction</em> of the error is far away from where it is <em>emitted</em>,
a problem similar to the one we faced with the <code>grep</code> approach.
In some cases, we buffer multiple errors in order to emit them in order.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invoking <code>rustc</code> with <code>-Z track-diagnostics</code> will print error creation
locations alongside the error.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The regular development practices apply: judicious use of <code>debug!()</code> statements
and use of a debugger to trigger break points in order to figure out in what
order things are happening.</p>
<h2 id="span"><a class="header" href="#span"><code>Span</code></a></h2>
<p><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_span/struct.Span.html"><code>Span</code></a> is the primary data structure in <code>rustc</code> used to represent a
location in the code being compiled. <code>Span</code>s are attached to most constructs in
HIR and MIR, allowing for more informative error reporting.</p>
<p>A <code>Span</code> can be looked up in a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_span/source_map/struct.SourceMap.html"><code>SourceMap</code></a> to get a &quot;snippet&quot;
useful for displaying errors with <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_span/source_map/struct.SourceMap.html#method.span_to_snippet"><code>span_to_snippet</code></a> and other
similar methods on the <code>SourceMap</code>.</p>
<h2 id="error-messages"><a class="header" href="#error-messages">Error messages</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_errors/index.html"><code>rustc_errors</code></a> crate defines most of the utilities used for
reporting errors.</p>
<p>Diagnostics can be implemented as types which implement the <code>IntoDiagnostic</code>
trait. This is preferred for new diagnostics as it enforces a separation
between diagnostic emitting logic and the main code paths. For less-complex
diagnostics, the <code>IntoDiagnostic</code> trait can be derived -- see <a href="./diagnostics/diagnostic-structs.html">Diagnostic
structs</a>. Within the trait implementation, the APIs
described below can be used as normal.</p>
<p><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_session/struct.Session.html"><code>Session</code></a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_session/parse/struct.ParseSess.html"><code>ParseSess</code></a> have
methods (or fields with methods) that allow reporting errors. These methods
usually have names like <code>span_err</code> or <code>struct_span_err</code> or <code>span_warn</code>, etc...
There are lots of them; they emit different types of &quot;errors&quot;, such as
warnings, errors, fatal errors, suggestions, etc.</p>
<p>In general, there are two classes of such methods: ones that emit an error
directly and ones that allow finer control over what to emit. For example,
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_session/struct.Session.html#method.span_err"><code>span_err</code></a> emits the given error message at the given <code>Span</code>, but
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_session/struct.Session.html#method.struct_span_err"><code>struct_span_err</code></a> instead returns a
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_errors/diagnostic_builder/struct.DiagnosticBuilder.html"><code>DiagnosticBuilder</code></a>.</p>
<p>Most of these methods will accept strings, but it is recommended that typed
identifiers for translatable diagnostics be used for new diagnostics (see
<a href="./diagnostics/translation.html">Translation</a>).</p>
<p><code>DiagnosticBuilder</code> allows you to add related notes and suggestions to an error
before emitting it by calling the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_errors/diagnostic_builder/struct.DiagnosticBuilder.html#method.emit"><code>emit</code></a> method. (Failing to either
emit or <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_errors/struct.Diagnostic.html#method.cancel">cancel</a> a <code>DiagnosticBuilder</code> will result in an ICE.) See the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_errors/diagnostic_builder/struct.DiagnosticBuilder.html">docs</a> for more info on what you can do.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">// Get a DiagnosticBuilder. This does _not_ emit an error yet.
let mut err = sess.struct_span_err(sp, fluent::example::example_error);

// In some cases, you might need to check if `sp` is generated by a macro to
// avoid printing weird errors about macro-generated code.

if let Ok(snippet) = sess.source_map().span_to_snippet(sp) {
    // Use the snippet to generate a suggested fix
    err.span_suggestion(suggestion_sp, fluent::example::try_qux_suggestion, format!(&quot;qux {}&quot;, snippet));
} else {
    // If we weren't able to generate a snippet, then emit a &quot;help&quot; message
    // instead of a concrete &quot;suggestion&quot;. In practice this is unlikely to be
    // reached.
    err.span_help(suggestion_sp, fluent::example::qux_suggestion);
}

// emit the error
err.emit();
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-fluent">example-example-error = oh no! this is an error!
  .try-qux-suggestion = try using a qux here
  .qux-suggestion = you could use a qux here instead
</code></pre>
<h2 id="suggestions"><a class="header" href="#suggestions">Suggestions</a></h2>
<p>In addition to telling the user exactly <em>why</em> their code is wrong, it's
oftentimes furthermore possible to tell them how to fix it. To this end,
<code>DiagnosticBuilder</code> offers a structured suggestions API, which formats code
suggestions pleasingly in the terminal, or (when the <code>--error-format json</code> flag
is passed) as JSON for consumption by tools like <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfix"><code>rustfix</code></a>.</p>
<p>Not all suggestions should be applied mechanically, they have a degree of
confidence in the suggested code, from high
(<code>Applicability::MachineApplicable</code>) to low (<code>Applicability::MaybeIncorrect</code>).
Be conservative when choosing the level. Use the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_errors/struct.DiagnosticBuilder.html#method.span_suggestion"><code>span_suggestion</code></a> method of <code>DiagnosticBuilder</code> to
make a suggestion. The last argument provides a hint to tools whether
the suggestion is mechanically applicable or not.</p>
<p>Suggestions point to one or more spans with corresponding code that will
replace their current content.</p>
<p>The message that accompanies them should be understandable in the following
contexts:</p>
<ul>
<li>shown as an independent sub-diagnostic (this is the default output)</li>
<li>shown as a label pointing at the affected span (this is done automatically if
some heuristics for verbosity are met)</li>
<li>shown as a <code>help</code> sub-diagnostic with no content (used for cases where the
suggestion is obvious from the text, but we still want to let tools to apply
them))</li>
<li>not shown (used for <em>very</em> obvious cases, but we still want to allow tools to
apply them)</li>

<h2 id="lints"><a class="header" href="#lints">Lints</a></h2>
<p>The compiler linting infrastructure is defined in the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/lint/index.html"><code>rustc_middle::lint</code></a>
module.</p>
<h3 id="declaring-a-lint"><a class="header" href="#declaring-a-lint">Declaring a lint</a></h3>
<p>The built-in compiler lints are defined in the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_lint/index.html"><code>rustc_lint</code></a>
crate. Lints that need to be implemented in other crates are defined in
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_lint_defs/index.html"><code>rustc_lint_defs</code></a>. You should prefer to place lints in <code>rustc_lint</code> if
possible. One benefit is that it is close to the dependency root, so it can be
much faster to work on.</p>
<p>Every lint is implemented via a <code>struct</code> that implements the <code>LintPass</code> <code>trait</code>
(you can also implement one of the more specific lint pass traits, either
<code>EarlyLintPass</code> or <code>LateLintPass</code> depending on when is best for your lint to run).
The trait implementation allows you to check certain syntactic constructs
as the linter walks the AST. You can then choose to emit lints in a
very similar way to compile errors.</p>
<p>You also declare the metadata of a particular lint via the <code>declare_lint!</code>
macro. This includes the name, the default level, a short description, and some
more details.</p>
<p>Note that the lint and the lint pass must be registered with the compiler.</p>
<p>For example, the following lint checks for uses
of <code>while true { ... }</code> and suggests using <code>loop { ... }</code> instead.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">// Declare a lint called `WHILE_TRUE`
declare_lint! {
    WHILE_TRUE,

    // warn-by-default
    Warn,

    // This string is the lint description
    &quot;suggest using `loop { }` instead of `while true { }`&quot;
}

// This declares a struct and a lint pass, providing a list of associated lints. The
// compiler currently doesn't use the associated lints directly (e.g., to not
// run the pass or otherwise check that the pass emits the appropriate set of
// lints). However, it's good to be accurate here as it's possible that we're
// going to register the lints via the get_lints method on our lint pass (that
// this macro generates).
declare_lint_pass!(WhileTrue =&gt; [WHILE_TRUE]);

// Helper function for `WhileTrue` lint.
// Traverse through any amount of parenthesis and return the first non-parens expression.
fn pierce_parens(mut expr: &amp;ast::Expr) -&gt; &amp;ast::Expr {
    while let ast::ExprKind::Paren(sub) = &amp;expr.kind {
        expr = sub;
    }
    expr
}

// `EarlyLintPass` has lots of methods. We only override the definition of
// `check_expr` for this lint because that's all we need, but you could
// override other methods for your own lint. See the rustc docs for a full
// list of methods.
impl EarlyLintPass for WhileTrue {
    fn check_expr(&amp;mut self, cx: &amp;EarlyContext&lt;'_&gt;, e: &amp;ast::Expr) {

<h3 id="edition-gated-lints"><a class="header" href="#edition-gated-lints">Edition-gated lints</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes we want to change the behavior of a lint in a new edition. To do this,
we just add the transition to our invocation of <code>declare_lint!</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">declare_lint! {
    pub ANONYMOUS_PARAMETERS,
    Allow,
    &quot;detects anonymous parameters&quot;,
    Edition::Edition2018 =&gt; Warn,
}
</code></pre>
<p>This makes the <code>ANONYMOUS_PARAMETERS</code> lint allow-by-default in the 2015 edition
but warn-by-default in the 2018 edition.</p>
<h3 id="feature-gated-lints"><a class="header" href="#feature-gated-lints">Feature-gated lints</a></h3>
<p>Lints belonging to a feature should only be usable if the feature is enabled in the
crate. To support this, lint declarations can contain a feature gate like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">declare_lint! {
    pub SOME_LINT_NAME,
    Warn,
    &quot;a new and useful, but feature gated lint&quot;,
    @feature_gate = sym::feature_name;
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="future-incompatible-lints"><a class="header" href="#future-incompatible-lints">Future-incompatible lints</a></h3>
<p>The use of the term <code>future-incompatible</code> within the compiler has a slightly
broader meaning than what rustc exposes to users of the compiler.</p>
<p>Inside rustc, future-incompatible lints are for signalling to the user that code they have
written may not compile in the future. In general, future-incompatible code
exists for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>the user has written unsound code that the compiler mistakenly accepted. While
it is within Rust's backwards compatibility guarantees to fix the soundness hole
(breaking the user's code), the lint is there to warn the user that this will happen
in some upcoming version of rustc <em>regardless of which edition the code uses</em>. This is the
meaning that rustc exclusively exposes to users as &quot;future incompatible&quot;.</li>
<li>the user has written code that will either no longer compiler <em>or</em> will change
meaning in an upcoming <em>edition</em>. These are often called &quot;edition lints&quot; and can be
typically seen in the various &quot;edition compatibility&quot; lint groups (e.g., <code>rust_2021_compatibility</code>)
that are used to lint against code that will break if the user updates the crate's edition.</li>
</ul>
<p>A future-incompatible lint should be declared with the <code>@future_incompatible</code>
additional &quot;field&quot;:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">declare_lint! {
    pub ANONYMOUS_PARAMETERS,
    Allow,
    &quot;detects anonymous parameters&quot;,
    @future_incompatible = FutureIncompatibleInfo {
        reference: &quot;issue #41686 &lt;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/41686&gt;&quot;,
        reason: FutureIncompatibilityReason::EditionError(Edition::Edition2018),
    };
}
</code></pre>
<p>Notice the <code>reason</code> field which describes why the future incompatible change is happening.
This will change the diagnostic message the user receives as well as determine which
lint groups the lint is added to. In the example above, the lint is an &quot;edition lint&quot;
(since it's &quot;reason&quot; is <code>EditionError</code>) signifying to the user that the use of anonymous
parameters will no longer compile in Rust 2018 and beyond.</p>
<p>Inside <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/51fd129ac12d5bfeca7d216c47b0e337bf13e0c2/compiler/rustc_lint/src/context.rs#L212-L237">LintStore::register_lints</a>, lints with <code>future_incompatible</code>
fields get placed into either edition-based lint groups (if their <code>reason</code> is tied to
an edition) or into the <code>future_incompatibility</code> lint group.</p>
<p>If you need a combination of options that's not supported by the
<code>declare_lint!</code> macro, you can always change the <code>declare_lint!</code> macro
to support this.</p>
<h3 id="renaming-or-removing-a-lint"><a class="header" href="#renaming-or-removing-a-lint">Renaming or removing a lint</a></h3>
<p>If it is determined that a lint is either improperly named or no longer needed,
the lint must be registered for renaming or removal, which will trigger a warning if a user tries
to use the old lint name. To declare a rename/remove, add a line with
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_lint/struct.LintStore.html#method.register_renamed"><code>store.register_renamed</code></a> or <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_lint/struct.LintStore.html#method.register_removed"><code>store.register_removed</code></a> to the code of the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_lint/fn.register_builtins.html"><code>rustc_lint::register_builtins</code></a> function.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">store.register_renamed(&quot;single_use_lifetime&quot;, &quot;single_use_lifetimes&quot;);
</code></pre>
<h3 id="lint-groups"><a class="header" href="#lint-groups">Lint Groups</a></h3>
<p>Lints can be turned on in groups. These groups are declared in the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_lint/fn.register_builtins.html"><code>register_builtins</code></a> function in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_lint/index.html"><code>rustc_lint::lib</code></a>. The
<code>add_lint_group!</code> macro is used to declare a new group.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">add_lint_group!(sess,
    &quot;nonstandard_style&quot;,
    NON_CAMEL_CASE_TYPES,
    NON_SNAKE_CASE,
    NON_UPPER_CASE_GLOBALS);
</code></pre>
<p>This defines the <code>nonstandard_style</code> group which turns on the listed lints. A
user can turn on these lints with a <code>!#[warn(nonstandard_style)]</code> attribute in
the source code, or by passing <code>-W nonstandard-style</code> on the command line.</p>
<p>Some lint groups are created automatically in <code>LintStore::register_lints</code>. For instance,
any lint declared with <code>FutureIncompatibleInfo</code> where the reason is
<code>FutureIncompatibilityReason::FutureReleaseError</code> (the default when
<code>@future_incompatible</code> is used in <code>declare_lint!</code>), will be added to
the <code>future_incompatible</code> lint group. Editions also have their own lint groups
(e.g., <code>rust_2021_compatibility</code>) automatically generated for any lints signaling
future-incompatible code that will break in the specified edition.</p>
<h3 id="linting-early-in-the-compiler"><a class="header" href="#linting-early-in-the-compiler">Linting early in the compiler</a></h3>
<p>On occasion, you may need to define a lint that runs before the linting system
has been initialized (e.g. during parsing or macro expansion). This is
problematic because we need to have computed lint levels to know whether we
should emit a warning or an error or nothing at all.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, we buffer the lints until the linting system is
processed. <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_session/struct.Session.html#method.buffer_lint"><code>Session</code></a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_session/parse/struct.ParseSess.html#method.buffer_lint"><code>ParseSess</code></a> both have
<code>buffer_lint</code> methods that allow you to buffer a lint for later. The linting
system automatically takes care of handling buffered lints later.</p>
<p>Thus, to define a lint that runs early in the compilation, one defines a lint
like normal but invokes the lint with <code>buffer_lint</code>.</p>
<h4 id="linting-even-earlier-in-the-compiler"><a class="header" href="#linting-even-earlier-in-the-compiler">Linting even earlier in the compiler</a></h4>
<p>The parser (<code>rustc_ast</code>) is interesting in that it cannot have dependencies on
any of the other <code>rustc*</code> crates. In particular, it cannot depend on
<code>rustc_middle::lint</code> or <code>rustc_lint</code>, where all of the compiler linting
infrastructure is defined. That's troublesome!</p>
<p>To solve this, <code>rustc_ast</code> defines its own buffered lint type, which
<code>ParseSess::buffer_lint</code> uses. After macro expansion, these buffered lints are
then dumped into the <code>Session::buffered_lints</code> used by the rest of the compiler.</p>
<h2 id="json-diagnostic-output"><a class="header" href="#json-diagnostic-output">JSON diagnostic output</a></h2>
<p>The compiler accepts an <code>--error-format json</code> flag to output
diagnostics as JSON objects (for the benefit of tools such as <code>cargo fix</code>). It looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-console">$ rustc json_error_demo.rs --error-format json
{&quot;message&quot;:&quot;cannot add `&amp;str` to `{integer}`&quot;,&quot;code&quot;:{&quot;code&quot;:&quot;E0277&quot;,&quot;explanation&quot;:&quot;\nYou tried to use a type which doesn't implement some trait in a place which\nexpected that trait. Erroneous code example:\n\n```compile_fail,E0277\n// here we declare the Foo trait with a bar method\ntrait Foo {\n    fn bar(&amp;self);\n}\n\n// we now declare a function which takes an object implementing the Foo trait\nfn some_func&lt;T: Foo&gt;(foo: T) {\n    foo.bar();\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    // we now call the method with the i32 type, which doesn't implement\n    // the Foo trait\n    some_func(5i32); // error: the trait bound `i32 : Foo` is not satisfied\n}\n```\n\nIn order to fix this error, verify that the type you're using does implement\nthe trait. Example:\n\n```\ntrait Foo {\n    fn bar(&amp;self);\n}\n\nfn some_func&lt;T: Foo&gt;(foo: T) {\n    foo.bar(); // we can now use this method since i32 implements the\n               // Foo trait\n}\n\n// we implement the trait on the i32 type\nimpl Foo for i32 {\n    fn bar(&amp;self) {}\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    some_func(5i32); // ok!\n}\n```\n\nOr in a generic context, an erroneous code example would look like:\n\n```compile_fail,E0277\nfn some_func&lt;T&gt;(foo: T) {\n    println!(\&quot;{:?}\&quot;, foo); // error: the trait `core::fmt::Debug` is not\n                           //        implemented for the type `T`\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    // We now call the method with the i32 type,\n    // which *does* implement the Debug trait.\n    some_func(5i32);\n}\n```\n\nNote that the error here is in the definition of the generic function: Although\nwe only call it with a parameter that does implement `Debug`, the compiler\nstill rejects the function: It must work with all possible input types. In\norder to make this example compile, we need to restrict the generic type we're\naccepting:\n\n```\nuse std::fmt;\n\n// Restrict the input type to types that implement Debug.\nfn some_func&lt;T: fmt::Debug&gt;(foo: T) {\n    println!(\&quot;{:?}\&quot;, foo);\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    // Calling the method is still fine, as i32 implements Debug.\n    some_func(5i32);\n\n    // This would fail to compile now:\n    // struct WithoutDebug;\n    // some_func(WithoutDebug);\n}\n```\n\nRust only looks at the signature of the called function, as such it must\nalready specify all requirements that will be used for every type parameter.\n&quot;},&quot;level&quot;:&quot;error&quot;,&quot;spans&quot;:[{&quot;file_name&quot;:&quot;json_error_demo.rs&quot;,&quot;byte_start&quot;:50,&quot;byte_end&quot;:51,&quot;line_start&quot;:4,&quot;line_end&quot;:4,&quot;column_start&quot;:7,&quot;column_end&quot;:8,&quot;is_primary&quot;:true,&quot;text&quot;:[{&quot;text&quot;:&quot;    a + b&quot;,&quot;highlight_start&quot;:7,&quot;highlight_end&quot;:8}],&quot;label&quot;:&quot;no implementation for `{integer} + &amp;str`&quot;,&quot;suggested_replacement&quot;:null,&quot;suggestion_applicability&quot;:null,&quot;expansion&quot;:null}],&quot;children&quot;:[{&quot;message&quot;:&quot;the trait `std::ops::Add&lt;&amp;str&gt;` is not implemented for `{integer}`&quot;,&quot;code&quot;:null,&quot;level&quot;:&quot;help&quot;,&quot;spans&quot;:[],&quot;children&quot;:[],&quot;rendered&quot;:null}],&quot;rendered&quot;:&quot;error[E0277]: cannot add `&amp;str` to `{integer}`\n --&gt; json_error_demo.rs:4:7\n  |\n4 |     a + b\n  |       ^ no implementation for `{integer} + &amp;str`\n  |\n  = help: the trait `std::ops::Add&lt;&amp;str&gt;` is not implemented for `{integer}`\n\n&quot;}

<p>Note that the output is a series of lines, each of which is a JSON
object, but the series of lines taken together is, unfortunately, not
valid JSON, thwarting tools and tricks (such as <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#module-json.tool">piping to <code>python3 -m json.tool</code></a>)
that require such. (One speculates that this was intentional for LSP
performance purposes, so that each line/object can be sent as
it is flushed?)</p>
<p>Also note the &quot;rendered&quot; field, which contains the &quot;human&quot; output as a
string; this was introduced so that UI tests could both make use of
the structured JSON and see the &quot;human&quot; output (well, <em>sans</em> colors)
without having to compile everything twice.</p>
<p>The &quot;human&quot; readable and the json format emitter can be found under

</code></pre>
<p>To allow more targeted error messages, it is possible to filter the
application of these fields based on a variety of attributes when using
<code>on</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>crate_local</code>: whether the code causing the trait bound to not be
fulfilled is part of the user's crate. This is used to avoid suggesting
code changes that would require modifying a dependency.</li>
<li>Any of the generic arguments that can be substituted in the text can be
referred by name as well for filtering, like <code>Rhs=&quot;i32&quot;</code>, except for
<code>Self</code>.</li>
<li><code>_Self</code>: to filter only on a particular calculated trait resolution, like
<code>Self=&quot;std::iter::Iterator&lt;char&gt;&quot;</code>. This is needed because <code>Self</code> is a
keyword which cannot appear in attributes.</li>
<li><code>direct</code>: user-specified rather than derived obligation.</li>
<li><code>from_method</code>: usable both as boolean (whether the flag is present, like
<code>crate_local</code>) or matching against a particular method. Currently used
for <code>try</code>.</li>
<li><code>from_desugaring</code>: usable both as boolean (whether the flag is present)
or matching against a particular desugaring. The desugaring is identified
with its variant name in the <code>DesugaringKind</code> enum.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the <code>Iterator</code> trait can be annotated in the following way:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">#[rustc_on_unimplemented(
    on(
        _Self=&quot;&amp;str&quot;,
        note=&quot;call `.chars()` or `.as_bytes()` on `{Self}`&quot;
    ),
    message=&quot;`{Self}` is not an iterator&quot;,
    label=&quot;`{Self}` is not an iterator&quot;,
    note=&quot;maybe try calling `.iter()` or a similar method&quot;
)]
pub trait Iterator {}
</code></pre>
<p>Which would produce the following outputs:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">error[E0277]: `Foo` is not an iterator
 --&gt; src/main.rs:4:16
  |
4 |     for foo in Foo {}

  = help: the trait `std::iter::Iterator` is not implemented for `&amp;str`
  = note: required by `std::iter::IntoIterator::into_iter`
</code></pre>
<p>If you need to filter on multiple attributes, you can use <code>all</code>, <code>any</code> or
<code>not</code> in the following way:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">#[rustc_on_unimplemented(
    on(

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="diagnostic-and-subdiagnostic-structs"><a class="header" href="#diagnostic-and-subdiagnostic-structs">Diagnostic and subdiagnostic structs</a></h1>
<p>rustc has two diagnostic derives that can be used to create simple diagnostics,
which are recommended to be used when they are applicable:
<code>#[derive(Diagnostic)]</code> and <code>#[derive(Subdiagnostic)]</code>.</p>
<p>Diagnostics created with the derive macros can be translated into different
languages and each has a slug that uniquely identifies the diagnostic.</p>
<h2 id="derivediagnostic"><a class="header" href="#derivediagnostic"><code>#[derive(Diagnostic)]</code></a></h2>
<p>Instead of using the <code>DiagnosticBuilder</code> API to create and emit diagnostics,
the <code>Diagnostic</code> derive can be used. <code>#[derive(Diagnostic)]</code> is
only applicable for simple diagnostics that don't require much logic in
deciding whether or not to add additional subdiagnostics.</p>
<p>Consider the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/6201eabde85db854c1ebb57624be5ec699246b50/compiler/rustc_hir_analysis/src/errors.rs#L68-L77">definition</a> of the &quot;field already declared&quot; diagnostic
shown below:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">#[derive(Diagnostic)]
#[diag(hir_analysis_field_already_declared, code = &quot;E0124&quot;)]
pub struct FieldAlreadyDeclared {
    pub field_name: Ident,
    #[primary_span]
    #[label]
    pub span: Span,
    #[label(hir_analysis_previous_decl_label)]
    pub prev_span: Span,
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>Diagnostic</code> can only be applied to structs and enums. 
Attributes that are placed on the type for structs are placed on each 
variants for enums (or vice versa). Each <code>Diagnostic</code> has to have one
attribute, <code>#[diag(...)]</code>, applied to the struct or each enum variant.</p>
<p>If an error has an error code (e.g. &quot;E0624&quot;), then that can be specified using
the <code>code</code> sub-attribute. Specifying a <code>code</code> isn't mandatory, but if you are
porting a diagnostic that uses <code>DiagnosticBuilder</code> to use <code>Diagnostic</code>
then you should keep the code if there was one.</p>
<p><code>#[diag(..)]</code> must provide a slug as the first positional argument (a path to an
item in <code>rustc_errors::fluent::*</code>). A slug uniquely identifies the diagnostic
and is also how the compiler knows what error message to emit (in the default
locale of the compiler, or in the locale requested by the user). See
<a href="diagnostics/./translation.html">translation documentation</a> to learn more about how
translatable error messages are written and how slug items are generated.</p>
<p>In our example, the Fluent message for the &quot;field already declared&quot; diagnostic
looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fluent">hir_analysis_field_already_declared =
    field `{$field_name}` is already declared
    .label = field already declared
    .previous_decl_label = `{$field_name}` first declared here
</code></pre>
<p><code>hir_analysis_field_already_declared</code> is the slug from our example and is followed
by the diagnostic message.</p>
<p>Every field of the <code>Diagnostic</code> which does not have an annotation is
available in Fluent messages as a variable, like <code>field_name</code> in the example
above. Fields can be annotated <code>#[skip_arg]</code> if this is undesired.</p>
<p>Using the <code>#[primary_span]</code> attribute on a field (that has type <code>Span</code>)
indicates the primary span of the diagnostic which will have the main message
of the diagnostic.</p>
<p>Diagnostics are more than just their primary message, they often include
labels, notes, help messages and suggestions, all of which can also be
specified on a <code>Diagnostic</code>.</p>
<p><code>#[label]</code>, <code>#[help]</code> and <code>#[note]</code> can all be applied to fields which have the
type <code>Span</code>. Applying any of these attributes will create the corresponding
subdiagnostic with that <code>Span</code>. These attributes will look for their
diagnostic message in a Fluent attribute attached to the primary Fluent
message. In our example, <code>#[label]</code> will look for
<code>hir_analysis_field_already_declared.label</code> (which has the message &quot;field already
declared&quot;). If there is more than one subdiagnostic of the same type, then
these attributes can also take a value that is the attribute name to look for
(e.g. <code>previous_decl_label</code> in our example).</p>
<p>Other types have special behavior when used in a <code>Diagnostic</code> derive:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any attribute applied to an <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> and will only emit a
subdiagnostic if the option is <code>Some(..)</code>.</li>
<li>Any attribute applied to a <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> will be repeated for each element of the
vector.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>#[help]</code> and <code>#[note]</code> can also be applied to the struct itself, in which case
they work exactly like when applied to fields except the subdiagnostic won't
have a <code>Span</code>. These attributes can also be applied to fields of type <code>()</code> for
the same effect, which when combined with the <code>Option</code> type can be used to
represent optional <code>#[note]</code>/<code>#[help]</code> subdiagnostics.</p>
<p>Suggestions can be emitted using one of four field attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>#[suggestion(slug, code = &quot;...&quot;, applicability = &quot;...&quot;)]</code></li>
<li><code>#[suggestion_hidden(slug, code = &quot;...&quot;, applicability = &quot;...&quot;)]</code></li>
<li><code>#[suggestion_short(slug, code = &quot;...&quot;, applicability = &quot;...&quot;)]</code></li>
<li><code>#[suggestion_verbose(slug, code = &quot;...&quot;, applicability = &quot;...&quot;)]</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Suggestions must be applied on either a <code>Span</code> field or a <code>(Span, MachineApplicability)</code> field. Similarly to other field attributes, the slug
specifies the Fluent attribute with the message and defaults to the equivalent
of <code>.suggestion</code>. <code>code</code> specifies the code that should be suggested as a
replacement and is a format string (e.g. <code>{field_name}</code> would be replaced by
the value of the <code>field_name</code> field of the struct), not a Fluent identifier.
<code>applicability</code> can be used to specify the applicability in the attribute, it
cannot be used when the field's type contains an <code>Applicability</code>.</p>
<p>In the end, the <code>Diagnostic</code> derive will generate an implementation of
<code>IntoDiagnostic</code> that looks like the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">impl IntoDiagnostic&lt;'_&gt; for FieldAlreadyDeclared {
    fn into_diagnostic(self, handler: &amp;'_ rustc_errors::Handler) -&gt; DiagnosticBuilder&lt;'_&gt; {
        let mut diag = handler.struct_err(rustc_errors::fluent::hir_analysis_field_already_declared);
        diag.set_span(self.span);
        diag.span_label(
            self.span,
            rustc_errors::fluent::hir_analysis_label
        );
        diag.span_label(
            self.prev_span,
            rustc_errors::fluent::hir_analysis_previous_decl_label
        );
        diag
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now that we've defined our diagnostic, how do we <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/f1112099eba41abadb6f921df7edba70affe92c5/compiler/rustc_hir_analysis/src/collect.rs#L823-L827">use it</a>? It's quite
straightforward, just create an instance of the struct and pass it to
<code>emit_err</code> (or <code>emit_warning</code>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">tcx.sess.emit_err(FieldAlreadyDeclared {
    field_name: f.ident,
    span: f.span,
    prev_span,
});

<h2 id="derivesubdiagnostic"><a class="header" href="#derivesubdiagnostic"><code>#[derive(Subdiagnostic)]</code></a></h2>
<p>It is common in the compiler to write a function that conditionally adds a
specific subdiagnostic to an error if it is applicable. Oftentimes these
subdiagnostics could be represented using a diagnostic struct even if the
overall diagnostic could not. In this circumstance, the <code>Subdiagnostic</code>
derive can be used to represent a partial diagnostic (e.g a note, label, help or
suggestion) as a struct.</p>
<p>Consider the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/f1112099eba41abadb6f921df7edba70affe92c5/compiler/rustc_hir_analysis/src/errors.rs#L221-L234">definition</a> of the &quot;expected return type&quot; label
shown below:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>#[derive(Subdiagnostic)]
pub enum ExpectedReturnTypeLabel&lt;'tcx&gt; {
    #[label(hir_analysis_expected_default_return_type)]
    Unit {
        #[primary_span]
        span: Span,
    },
    #[label(hir_analysis_expected_return_type)]
    Other {
        #[primary_span]
        span: Span,
        expected: Ty&lt;'tcx&gt;,
    },
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Like <code>Diagnostic</code>, <code>Subdiagnostic</code> can be applied to structs or
enums. Attributes that are placed on the type for structs are placed on each
variants for enums (or vice versa). Each <code>Subdiagnostic</code> should have one
attribute applied to the struct or each variant, one of:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>#[label(..)]</code> for defining a label</li>
<li><code>#[note(..)]</code> for defining a note</li>
<li><code>#[help(..)]</code> for defining a help</li>
<li><code>#[suggestion{,_hidden,_short,_verbose}(..)]</code> for defining a suggestion</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the above must provide a slug as the first positional argument (a path
to an item in <code>rustc_errors::fluent::*</code>). A slug uniquely identifies the
diagnostic and is also how the compiler knows what error message to emit (in
the default locale of the compiler, or in the locale requested by the user).
See <a href="diagnostics/./translation.html">translation documentation</a> to learn more about how
translatable error messages are written and how slug items are generated.</p>
<p>In our example, the Fluent message for the &quot;expected return type&quot; label
looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fluent">hir_analysis_expected_default_return_type = expected `()` because of default return type

hir_analysis_expected_return_type = expected `{$expected}` because of return type
</code></pre>
<p>Using the <code>#[primary_span]</code> attribute on a field (with type <code>Span</code>) will denote
the primary span of the subdiagnostic. A primary span is only necessary for a
label or suggestion, which can not be spanless.</p>
<p>Every field of the type/variant which does not have an annotation is available
in Fluent messages as a variable. Fields can be annotated <code>#[skip_arg]</code> if this
is undesired.</p>
<p>Like <code>Diagnostic</code>, <code>Subdiagnostic</code> supports <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> and
<code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> fields.</p>
<p>Suggestions can be emitted using one of four attributes on the type/variant:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>#[suggestion(..., code = &quot;...&quot;, applicability = &quot;...&quot;)]</code></li>
<li><code>#[suggestion_hidden(..., code = &quot;...&quot;, applicability = &quot;...&quot;)]</code></li>
<li><code>#[suggestion_short(..., code = &quot;...&quot;, applicability = &quot;...&quot;)]</code></li>
<li><code>#[suggestion_verbose(..., code = &quot;...&quot;, applicability = &quot;...&quot;)]</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Suggestions require <code>#[primary_span]</code> be set on a field and can have the
following sub-attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first positional argument specifies the path to a item in
<code>rustc_errors::fluent</code> corresponding to the Fluent attribute with the message
and defaults to the equivalent of <code>.suggestion</code>.</li>
<li><code>code</code> specifies the code that should be suggested as a replacement and is a
format string (e.g. <code>{field_name}</code> would be replaced by the value of the
<code>field_name</code> field of the struct), not a Fluent identifier.</li>
<li><code>applicability</code> can be used to specify the applicability in the attribute, it
cannot be used when the field's type contains an <code>Applicability</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Applicabilities can also be specified as a field (of type <code>Applicability</code>)
using the <code>#[applicability]</code> attribute.</p>
<p>In the end, the <code>Subdiagnostic</code> derive will generate an implementation
of <code>AddToDiagnostic</code> that looks like the following:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>impl&lt;'tcx&gt; AddToDiagnostic for ExpectedReturnTypeLabel&lt;'tcx&gt; {

        match self {
            ExpectedReturnTypeLabel::Unit { span } =&gt; {
                diag.span_label(span, rustc_errors::fluent::hir_analysis_expected_default_return_type)
            }
            ExpectedReturnTypeLabel::Other { span, expected } =&gt; {
                diag.set_arg(&quot;expected&quot;, expected);
                diag.span_label(span, rustc_errors::fluent::hir_analysis_expected_return_type)
            }

        }
    }
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>Once defined, a subdiagnostic can be used by passing it to the <code>subdiagnostic</code>
function (<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/f1112099eba41abadb6f921df7edba70affe92c5/compiler/rustc_hir_analysis/src/check/fn_ctxt/suggestions.rs#L670-L674">example</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/f1112099eba41abadb6f921df7edba70affe92c5/compiler/rustc_hir_analysis/src/check/fn_ctxt/suggestions.rs#L704-L707">example</a>) on a

<p>rustc's diagnostic infrastructure supports translatable diagnostics using
<a href="https://projectfluent.org">Fluent</a>.</p>
<h2 id="writing-translatable-diagnostics"><a class="header" href="#writing-translatable-diagnostics">Writing translatable diagnostics</a></h2>
<p>There are two ways of writing translatable diagnostics:</p>
<ol>
<li>For simple diagnostics, using a diagnostic (or subdiagnostic) derive
(&quot;simple&quot; diagnostics being those that don't require a lot of logic in
deciding to emit subdiagnostics and can therefore be represented as
diagnostic structs). See <a href="diagnostics/./diagnostic-structs.html">the diagnostic and subdiagnostic structs
documentation</a>.</li>
<li>Using typed identifiers with <code>DiagnosticBuilder</code> APIs (in
<code>Diagnostic</code> implementations).</li>
</ol>
<p>When adding or changing a translatable diagnostic, you don't need to worry
about the translations, only updating the original English message. Currently,
each crate which defines translatable diagnostics has its own Fluent resource,
such as <code>parser.ftl</code> or <code>typeck.ftl</code>.</p>
<h2 id="fluent"><a class="header" href="#fluent">Fluent</a></h2>
<p>Fluent is built around the idea of &quot;asymmetric localization&quot;, which aims to
decouple the expressiveness of translations from the grammar of the source
language (English in rustc's case). Prior to translation, rustc's diagnostics
relied heavily on interpolation to build the messages shown to the users.
Interpolated strings are hard to translate because writing a natural-sounding
translation might require more, less, or just different interpolation than the
English string, all of which would require changes to the compiler's source
code to support.</p>
<p>Diagnostic messages are defined in Fluent resources. A combined set of Fluent
resources for a given locale (e.g. <code>en-US</code>) is known as Fluent bundle.</p>
<pre><code class="language-fluent">typeck_address_of_temporary_taken = cannot take address of a temporary
</code></pre>
<p>In the above example, <code>typeck_address_of_temporary_taken</code> is the identifier for
a Fluent message and corresponds to the diagnostic message in English. Other
Fluent resources can be written which would correspond to a message in another
language. Each diagnostic therefore has at least one Fluent message.</p>
<pre><code class="language-fluent">typeck_address_of_temporary_taken = cannot take address of a temporary
    .label = temporary value
</code></pre>
<p>By convention, diagnostic messages for subdiagnostics are specified as
&quot;attributes&quot; on Fluent messages (additional related messages, denoted by the
<code>.&lt;attribute-name&gt;</code> syntax). In the above example, <code>label</code> is an attribute of
<code>typeck_address_of_temporary_taken</code> which corresponds to the message for the
label added to this diagnostic.</p>
<p>Diagnostic messages often interpolate additional context into the message shown
to the user, such as the name of a type or of a variable. Additional context to
Fluent messages is provided as an &quot;argument&quot; to the diagnostic.</p>
<pre><code class="language-fluent">typeck_struct_expr_non_exhaustive =
    cannot create non-exhaustive {$what} using struct expression
</code></pre>
<p>In the above example, the Fluent message refers to an argument named <code>what</code>
which is expected to exist (how arguments are provided to diagnostics is
discussed in detail later).</p>
<p>You can consult the <a href="https://projectfluent.org">Fluent</a> documentation for other usage examples of Fluent
and its syntax.</p>
<h3 id="guideline-for-message-naming"><a class="header" href="#guideline-for-message-naming">Guideline for message naming</a></h3>
<p>Usually, fluent uses <code>-</code> for separating words inside a message name. However,
<code>_</code> is accepted by fluent as well. As <code>_</code> fits Rust's use cases better, due to
the identifiers on the Rust side using <code>_</code> as well, inside rustc, <code>-</code> is not
allowed for separating words, and instead <code>_</code> is recommended. The only exception
is for leading <code>-</code>s, for message names like <code>-passes_see_issue</code>.</p>
<h3 id="guidelines-for-writing-translatable-messages"><a class="header" href="#guidelines-for-writing-translatable-messages">Guidelines for writing translatable messages</a></h3>
<p>For a message to be translatable into different languages, all of the
information required by any language must be provided to the diagnostic as an
argument (not just the information required in the English message).</p>
<p>As the compiler team gain more experience writing diagnostics that have all of
the information necessary to be translated into different languages, this page
will be updated with more guidance. For now, the <a href="https://projectfluent.org">Fluent</a> documentation has
excellent examples of translating messages into different locales and the
information that needs to be provided by the code to do so.</p>
<h3 id="compile-time-validation-and-typed-identifiers"><a class="header" href="#compile-time-validation-and-typed-identifiers">Compile-time validation and typed identifiers</a></h3>
<p>rustc's Fluent resources for the default locale (<code>en-US</code>) are in the
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/compiler/rustc_error_messages/locales/en-US"><code>compiler/rustc_error_messages/locales/en-US</code></a> directory. Currently, each crate
which defines translatable diagnostics has its own Fluent resource, such as
<code>parser.ftl</code> or <code>typeck.ftl</code>.</p>
<p>rustc's <code>fluent_messages</code> macro performs compile-time validation of Fluent
resources and generates code to make it easier to refer to Fluent messages in
diagnostics.</p>
<p>Compile-time validation of Fluent resources will emit any parsing errors
from Fluent resources while building the compiler, preventing invalid Fluent
resources from causing panics in the compiler. Compile-time validation also
emits an error if multiple Fluent messages have the same identifier.</p>
<p>In <code>rustc_error_messages</code>, <code>fluent_messages</code> also generates a constant for each
Fluent message which can be used to refer to messages when emitting
diagnostics and guarantee that the message exists.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>fluent_messages! {
    typeck =&gt; &quot;../locales/en-US/typeck.ftl&quot;,
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>For example, given the following Fluent...</p>
<pre><code class="language-fluent">typeck_field_multiply_specified_in_initializer =
    field `{$ident}` specified more than once
    .label = used more than once
    .label_previous_use = first use of `{$ident}`
</code></pre>
<p>...then the <code>fluent_messages</code> macro will generate:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>pub static DEFAULT_LOCALE_RESOURCES: &amp;'static [&amp;'static str] = &amp;[
    include_str!(&quot;../locales/en-US/typeck.ftl&quot;),
];

mod fluent_generated {
    pub const typeck_field_multiply_specified_in_initializer: DiagnosticMessage =
        DiagnosticMessage::new(&quot;typeck_field_multiply_specified_in_initializer&quot;);
    pub const label: SubdiagnosticMessage =
        SubdiagnosticMessage::attr(&quot;label&quot;);
    pub const label_previous_use: SubdiagnosticMessage =
        SubdiagnosticMessage::attr(&quot;previous_use_label&quot;);
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p><code>rustc_error_messages::fluent_generated</code> is re-exported and primarily used as
<code>rustc_errors::fluent</code>.</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>use rustc_errors::fluent;
let mut err = sess.struct_span_err(span, fluent::typeck_field_multiply_specified_in_initializer);
err.span_label(span, fluent::label);
err.span_label(previous_use_span, fluent::previous_use_label);
err.emit();
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>When emitting a diagnostic, these constants can be used like shown above.</p>
<h2 id="internals"><a class="header" href="#internals">Internals</a></h2>
<p>Various parts of rustc's diagnostic internals are modified in order to support
translation.</p>
<h3 id="messages"><a class="header" href="#messages">Messages</a></h3>
<p>All of rustc's traditional diagnostic APIs (e.g. <code>struct_span_err</code> or <code>note</code>)
take any message that can be converted into a <code>DiagnosticMessage</code> (or
<code>SubdiagnosticMessage</code>).</p>
<p><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_error_messages/enum.DiagnosticMessage.html"><code>rustc_error_messages::DiagnosticMessage</code></a> can represent legacy non-translatable
diagnostic messages and translatable messages. Non-translatable messages are
just <code>String</code>s. Translatable messages are just a <code>&amp;'static str</code> with the
identifier of the Fluent message (sometimes with an additional <code>&amp;'static str</code>
with an attribute).</p>
<p><code>DiagnosticMessage</code> never needs to be interacted with directly:
<code>DiagnosticMessage</code> constants are created for each diagnostic message in a
Fluent resource (described in more detail below), or <code>DiagnosticMessage</code>s will
either be created in the macro-generated code of a diagnostic derive.</p>
<p><code>rustc_error_messages::SubdiagnosticMessage</code> is similar, it can correspond to a
legacy non-translatable diagnostic message or the name of an attribute to a
Fluent message. Translatable <code>SubdiagnosticMessage</code>s must be combined with a
<code>DiagnosticMessage</code> (using <code>DiagnosticMessage::with_subdiagnostic_message</code>) to
be emitted (an attribute name on its own is meaningless without a corresponding
message identifier, which is what <code>DiagnosticMessage</code> provides).</p>
<p>Both <code>DiagnosticMessage</code> and <code>SubdiagnosticMessage</code> implement <code>Into</code> for any
type that can be converted into a string, and converts these into
non-translatable diagnostics - this keeps all existing diagnostic calls
working.</p>
<h3 id="arguments"><a class="header" href="#arguments">Arguments</a></h3>
<p>Additional context for Fluent messages which are interpolated into message
contents needs to be provided to translatable diagnostics.</p>
<p>Diagnostics have a <code>set_arg</code> function that can be used to provide this
additional context to a diagnostic.</p>
<p>Arguments have both a name (e.g. &quot;what&quot; in the earlier example) and a value.
Argument values are represented using the <code>DiagnosticArgValue</code> type, which is
just a string or a number. rustc types can implement <code>IntoDiagnosticArg</code> with
conversion into a string or a number, common types like <code>Ty&lt;'tcx&gt;</code> already
have such implementations.</p>
<p><code>set_arg</code> calls are handled transparently by diagnostic derives but need to be
added manually when using diagnostic builder APIs.</p>
<h3 id="loading"><a class="header" href="#loading">Loading</a></h3>
<p>rustc makes a distinction between the &quot;fallback bundle&quot; for <code>en-US</code> that is used
by default and when another locale is missing a message; and the primary fluent
bundle which is requested by the user.</p>
<p>Diagnostic emitters implement the <code>Emitter</code> trait which has two functions for
accessing the fallback and primary fluent bundles (<code>fallback_fluent_bundle</code> and
<code>fluent_bundle</code> respectively).</p>
<p><code>Emitter</code> also has member functions with default implementations for performing
translation of a <code>DiagnosticMessage</code> using the results of
<code>fallback_fluent_bundle</code> and <code>fluent_bundle</code>.</p>
<p>All of the emitters in rustc load the fallback Fluent bundle lazily, only
reading Fluent resources and parsing them when an error message is first being
translated (for performance reasons - it doesn't make sense to do this if no
error is being emitted). <code>rustc_error_messages::fallback_fluent_bundle</code> returns
a <code>std::lazy::Lazy&lt;FluentBundle&gt;</code> which is provided to emitters and evaluated
in the first call to <code>Emitter::fallback_fluent_bundle</code>.</p>
<p>The primary Fluent bundle (for the user's desired locale) is expected to be
returned by <code>Emitter::fluent_bundle</code>. This bundle is used preferentially when
translating messages, the fallback bundle is only used if the primary bundle is
missing a message or not provided.</p>
<p>As of <!-- date-check --> Jan 2023, there are no locale bundles
distributed with the compiler, but mechanisms are implemented for loading
bundles.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-Ztranslate-additional-ftl</code> can be used to load a specific resource as the
primary bundle for testing purposes.</li>
<li><code>-Ztranslate-lang</code> can be provided a language identifier (something like
<code>en-US</code>) and will load any Fluent resources found in
<code>$sysroot/share/locale/$locale/</code> directory (both the user provided
sysroot and any sysroot candidates).</li>
</ul>
<p>Primary bundles are not currently loaded lazily and if requested will be loaded
at the start of compilation regardless of whether an error occurs. Lazily
loading primary bundles is possible if it can be assumed that loading a bundle
won't fail. Bundle loading can fail if a requested locale is missing, Fluent
files are malformed, or a message is duplicated in multiple resources.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="lints-1"><a class="header" href="#lints-1">Lints</a></h1>
<p>This page documents some of the machinery around lint registration and how we
run lints in the compiler.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_lint/struct.LintStore.html"><code>LintStore</code></a> is the central piece of infrastructure, around which
everything rotates. It's not available during the early parts of compilation
(i.e., before TyCtxt) in most code, as we need to fill it in with all of the
lints, which can only happen after plugin registration.</p>
<h2 id="lints-vs-lint-passes"><a class="header" href="#lints-vs-lint-passes">Lints vs. lint passes</a></h2>
<p>There are two parts to the linting mechanism within the compiler: lints and
lint passes. Unfortunately, a lot of the documentation we have refers to both
of these as just &quot;lints.&quot;</p>
<p>First, we have the lint declarations themselves,
and this is where the name and default lint level and other metadata come from.
These are normally defined by way of the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_session/macro.declare_lint.html"><code>declare_lint!</code></a> macro,
which boils down to a static with type <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_lint_defs/struct.Lint.html"><code>&amp;rustc_lint_defs::Lint</code></a>
(although this may change in the future,
as the macro is somewhat unwieldy to add new fields to,
like all macros).</p>
<p>As of <!-- date-check --> Aug 2022,
we lint against direct declarations without the use of the macro.</p>
<p>Lint declarations don't carry any &quot;state&quot; - they are merely global identifiers
and descriptions of lints. We assert at runtime that they are not registered
twice (by lint name).</p>
<p>Lint passes are the meat of any lint. Notably, there is not a one-to-one
relationship between lints and lint passes; a lint might not have any lint pass
that emits it, it could have many, or just one -- the compiler doesn't track
whether a pass is in any way associated with a particular lint, and frequently
lints are emitted as part of other work (e.g., type checking, etc.).</p>
<h2 id="registration"><a class="header" href="#registration">Registration</a></h2>
<h3 id="high-level-overview"><a class="header" href="#high-level-overview">High-level overview</a></h3>
<p>In <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_interface/passes/fn.register_plugins.html"><code>rustc_interface::register_plugins</code></a>,
the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_lint/struct.LintStore.html"><code>LintStore</code></a> is created,
and all lints are registered.</p>
<p>There are four 'sources' of lints:</p>
<ul>
<li>internal lints: lints only used by the rustc codebase</li>
<li>builtin lints: lints built into the compiler and not provided by some outside
source</li>
<li>plugin lints: lints created by plugins through the plugin system.</li>
<li><code>rustc_interface::Config</code><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_interface/interface/struct.Config.html#structfield.register_lints"><code>register_lints</code></a>: lints passed into the compiler
during construction</li>
</ul>
<p>Lints are registered via the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_lint/struct.LintStore.html#method.register_lints"><code>LintStore::register_lint</code></a> function. This should
happen just once for any lint, or an ICE will occur.</p>
<p>Once the registration is complete, we &quot;freeze&quot; the lint store by placing it in
an <code>Lrc</code>. Later in the driver, it's passed into the <code>GlobalCtxt</code> constructor
where it lives in an immutable form from then on.</p>
<p>Lint passes are registered separately into one of the categories
(pre-expansion, early, late, late module). Passes are registered as a closure
-- i.e., <code>impl Fn() -&gt; Box&lt;dyn X&gt;</code>, where <code>dyn X</code> is either an early or late
lint pass trait object. When we run the lint passes, we run the closure and
then invoke the lint pass methods. The lint pass methods take <code>&amp;mut self</code> so
they can keep track of state internally.</p>
<h4 id="internal-lints"><a class="header" href="#internal-lints">Internal lints</a></h4>
<p>These are lints used just by the compiler or plugins like <code>clippy</code>. They can be
found in <code>rustc_lint::internal</code>.</p>
<p>An example of such a lint is the check that lint passes are implemented using
the <code>declare_lint_pass!</code> macro and not by hand. This is accomplished with the
<code>LINT_PASS_IMPL_WITHOUT_MACRO</code> lint.</p>
<p>Registration of these lints happens in the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_lint/fn.register_internals.html"><code>rustc_lint::register_internals</code></a>
function which is called when constructing a new lint store inside
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_lint/fn.new_lint_store.html"><code>rustc_lint::new_lint_store</code></a>.</p>
<h3 id="builtin-lints"><a class="header" href="#builtin-lints">Builtin Lints</a></h3>
<p>These are primarily described in two places,
<code>rustc_lint_defs::builtin</code> and <code>rustc_lint::builtin</code>.
Often the first provides the definitions for the lints themselves,
and the latter provides the lint pass definitions (and implementations),
but this is not always true.</p>
<p>The builtin lint registration happens in
the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_lint/fn.register_builtins.html"><code>rustc_lint::register_builtins</code></a> function.
Just like with internal lints,
this happens inside of <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_lint/fn.new_lint_store.html"><code>rustc_lint::new_lint_store</code></a>.</p>
<h4 id="plugin-lints"><a class="header" href="#plugin-lints">Plugin lints</a></h4>
<p>This is one of the primary use cases remaining for plugins/drivers. Plugins are
given access to the mutable <code>LintStore</code> during registration (which happens
inside of <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_interface/passes/fn.register_plugins.html"><code>rustc_interface::register_plugins</code></a>) and they can call any
functions they need on the <code>LintStore</code>, just like rustc code.</p>
<p>Plugins are intended to declare lints with the <code>plugin</code> field set to true
(e.g., by way of the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_session/macro.declare_tool_lint.html"><code>declare_tool_lint!</code></a> macro), but this is purely for
diagnostics and help text; otherwise plugin lints are mostly just as first
class as rustc builtin lints.</p>
<h4 id="driver-lints"><a class="header" href="#driver-lints">Driver lints</a></h4>
<p>These are the lints provided by drivers via the <code>rustc_interface::Config</code>
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_interface/interface/struct.Config.html#structfield.register_lints"><code>register_lints</code></a> field, which is a callback. Drivers should, if finding it
already set, call the function currently set within the callback they add. The
best way for drivers to get access to this is by overriding the
<code>Callbacks::config</code> function which gives them direct access to the <code>Config</code>
structure.</p>
<h2 id="compiler-lint-passes-are-combined-into-one-pass"><a class="header" href="#compiler-lint-passes-are-combined-into-one-pass">Compiler lint passes are combined into one pass</a></h2>
<p>Within the compiler, for performance reasons, we usually do not register dozens
of lint passes. Instead, we have a single lint pass of each variety (e.g.,
<code>BuiltinCombinedModuleLateLintPass</code>) which will internally call all of the
individual lint passes; this is because then we get the benefits of static over
dynamic dispatch for each of the (often empty) trait methods.</p>
<p>Ideally, we'd not have to do this, since it adds to the complexity of
understanding the code. However, with the current type-erased lint store
approach, it is beneficial to do so for performance reasons.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="diagnostic-codes"><a class="header" href="#diagnostic-codes">Diagnostic codes</a></h1>
<p>We generally try to assign each error message a unique code like <code>E0123</code>. These
codes are defined in the compiler in the <code>diagnostics.rs</code> files found in each
crate, which basically consist of macros. The codes come in two varieties: those
that have an extended write-up, and those that do not. Whenever possible, if you
are making a new code, you should write an extended write-up.</p>
<h3 id="allocating-a-fresh-code"><a class="header" href="#allocating-a-fresh-code">Allocating a fresh code</a></h3>
<p>Error codes are stored in <code>compiler/rustc_error_codes</code>.</p>
<p>To create a new error, you first need to find the next available
code. You can find it with <code>tidy</code>:</p>
<pre><code>./x.py test tidy
</code></pre>
<p>This will invoke the tidy script, which generally checks that your code obeys
our coding conventions. One of those jobs is to check that diagnostic codes are
indeed unique. Once it is finished with that, tidy will print out the lowest
unused code:</p>
<pre><code>...
tidy check (x86_64-apple-darwin)
* 470 error codes
* highest error code: E0591
...
</code></pre>
<p>Here we see the highest error code in use is <code>E0591</code>, so we <em>probably</em> want
<code>E0592</code>. To be sure, run <code>rg E0592</code> and check, you should see no references.</p>
<p>Ideally, you will write an extended description for your error,
which will go in <code>rustc_error_codes/src/error_codes/E0592.md</code>.
To register the error, open <code>rustc_error_codes/src/error_codes.rs</code> and add the
code (in its proper numerical order) into<code> register_diagnostics!</code> macro, like
this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>register_diagnostics! {
    ...
    E0592: include_str!(&quot;./error_codes/E0592.md&quot;),
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>But you can also add it without an extended description:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>register_diagnostics! {
    ...
    E0592, // put a description here
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>To actually issue the error, you can use the <code>struct_span_err!</code> macro:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>struct_span_err!(self.tcx.sess, // some path to the session here
                 span, // whatever span in the source you want
                 E0592, // your new error code
                 fluent::example::an_error_message)
    .emit() // actually issue the error
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>If you want to add notes or other snippets, you can invoke methods before you
call <code>.emit()</code>:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>struct_span_err!(...)
    .span_label(another_span, fluent::example::example_label)
    .span_note(another_span, fluent::example::separate_note)
    .emit_()
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="diagnostic-items"><a class="header" href="#diagnostic-items">Diagnostic Items</a></h1>
<p>While writing lints it's common to check for specific types, traits and
functions. This raises the question on how to check for these. Types can be
checked by their complete type path. However, this requires hard coding paths
and can lead to misclassifications in some edge cases. To counteract this,
rustc has introduced diagnostic items that are used to identify types via
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_span/symbol/struct.Symbol.html"><code>Symbol</code></a>s.</p>
<h2 id="finding-diagnostic-items"><a class="header" href="#finding-diagnostic-items">Finding diagnostic items</a></h2>
<p>Diagnostic items are added to items inside <code>rustc</code>/<code>std</code>/<code>core</code>/<code>alloc</code> with the
<code>rustc_diagnostic_item</code> attribute. The item for a specific type can be found by
opening the source code in the documentation and looking for this attribute.
Note that it's often added with the <code>cfg_attr</code> attribute to avoid compilation
errors during tests. A definition often looks like this:</p>

<p>Diagnostic items are usually only added to traits,
types,
and standalone functions.
If the goal is to check for an associated type or method,
please use the diagnostic item of the item and reference

<h2 id="adding-diagnostic-items"><a class="header" href="#adding-diagnostic-items">Adding diagnostic items</a></h2>
<p>A new diagnostic item can be added with these two steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Find the target item inside the Rust repo. Now add the diagnostic item as a
string via the <code>rustc_diagnostic_item</code> attribute. This can sometimes cause
compilation errors while running tests. These errors can be avoided by using
the <code>cfg_attr</code> attribute with the <code>not(test)</code> condition (it's fine adding
then for all <code>rustc_diagnostic_item</code> attributes as a preventive manner). At
the end, it should look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rs">// This will be the new diagnostic item        vvv
#[cfg_attr(not(test), rustc_diagnostic_item = &quot;Cat&quot;)]
struct Cat;
</code></pre>
<p>For the naming conventions of diagnostic items, please refer to
<a href="diagnostics/diagnostic-items.html#naming-conventions"><em>Naming Conventions</em></a>.</p>
</li>
<li><!-- date-check: Aug 2022 -->
<p>Diagnostic items in code are accessed via symbols in
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_span/symbol/sym/index.html"><code>rustc_span::symbol::sym</code></a>.
To add your newly-created diagnostic item,
simply open the module file,
and add the name (In this case <code>Cat</code>) at the correct point in the list.</p>
</li>

<h2 id="naming-conventions-1"><a class="header" href="#naming-conventions-1">Naming conventions</a></h2>
<p>Diagnostic items don't have a naming convention yet.
Following are some guidelines that should be used in future,
but might differ from existing names:</p>
<ul>
<li>Types, traits, and enums are named using UpperCamelCase
(Examples: <code>Iterator</code> and <code>HashMap</code>)</li>
<li>For type names that are used multiple times,
like <code>Writer</code>,
it's good to choose a more precise name,
maybe by adding the module to it
(Example: <code>IoWriter</code>)</li>
<li>Associated items should not get their own diagnostic items,
but instead be accessed indirectly by the diagnostic item
of the type they're originating from.</li>
<li>Freestanding functions like <code>std::mem::swap()</code> should be named using
<code>snake_case</code> with one important (export) module as a prefix
(Examples: <code>mem_swap</code> and <code>cmp_max</code>)</li>
<li>Modules should usually not have a diagnostic item attached to them.
Diagnostic items were added to avoid the usage of paths,
and using them on modules would therefore most likely be counterproductive.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="using-diagnostic-items"><a class="header" href="#using-diagnostic-items">Using diagnostic items</a></h2>
<p>In rustc, diagnostic items are looked up via <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_span/symbol/struct.Symbol.html"><code>Symbol</code></a>s from inside the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_span/symbol/sym/index.html"><code>rustc_span::symbol::sym</code></a> module. These can then be mapped to <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_hir/def_id/struct.DefId.html"><code>DefId</code></a>s

using <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/context/struct.TyCtxt.html#method.is_diagnostic_item"><code>TyCtxt::is_diagnostic_item()</code></a>. When mapping from a diagnostic item to
a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_hir/def_id/struct.DefId.html"><code>DefId</code></a>, the method will return a <code>Option&lt;DefId&gt;</code>. This can be <code>None</code> if
either the symbol isn't a diagnostic item or the type is not registered, for
instance when compiling with <code>#[no_std]</code>.

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="errorguaranteed"><a class="header" href="#errorguaranteed"><code>ErrorGuaranteed</code></a></h1>
<p>The previous sections have been about the error message that a user of the
compiler sees. But emitting an error can also have a second important side
effect within the compiler source code: it generates an
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_errors/struct.ErrorGuaranteed.html"><code>ErrorGuaranteed</code></a>.</p>
<p><code>ErrorGuaranteed</code> is a zero-sized type that is unconstructable outside of the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_errors/index.html"><code>rustc_errors</code></a> crate. It is generated whenever an error is reported
to the user, so that if your compiler code ever encounters a value of type
<code>ErrorGuaranteed</code>, the compilation is <em>statically guaranteed to fail</em>. This is
useful for avoiding unsoundness bugs because you can statically check that an
error code path leads to a failure.</p>
<p>There are some important considerations about the usage of <code>ErrorGuaranteed</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>It does <em>not</em> convey information about the <em>kind</em> of error. For example, the
error may be due (indirectly) to a <code>delay_span_bug</code> or other compiler error.
Thus, you should not rely on
<code>ErrorGuaranteed</code> when deciding whether to emit an error, or what kind of error
to emit.</li>
<li><code>ErrorGuaranteed</code> should not be used to indicate that a compilation <em>will
emit</em> an error in the future. It should be used to indicate that an error
<em>has already been</em> emitted -- that is, the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_errors/diagnostic_builder/struct.DiagnosticBuilder.html#method.emit"><code>emit()</code></a> function has
already been called.  For example, if we detect that a future part of the
compiler will error, we <em>cannot</em> use <code>ErrorGuaranteed</code> unless we first emit
an error ourselves.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thankfully, in most cases, it should be statically impossible to abuse
<code>ErrorGuaranteed</code>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="from-mir-to-binaries"><a class="header" href="#from-mir-to-binaries">From MIR to Binaries</a></h1>
<p>All of the preceding chapters of this guide have one thing in common:
we never generated any executable machine code at all!
With this chapter, all of that changes.</p>
<p>So far,
we've shown how the compiler can take raw source code in text format
and transform it into <a href="./mir/index.html">MIR</a>.
We have also shown how the compiler does various
analyses on the code to detect things like type or lifetime errors.
Now, we will finally take the MIR and produce some executable machine code.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: This part of a compiler is often called the <em>backend</em>.
The term is a bit overloaded because in the compiler source,
it usually refers to the &quot;codegen backend&quot; (i.e. LLVM, Cranelift, or GCC).
Usually, when you see the word &quot;backend&quot;  in this part,
we are referring to the &quot;codegen backend&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what do we need to do?</p>
<ol>
<li>First, we need to collect the set of things to generate code for.
In particular,
we need to find out which concrete types to substitute for generic ones,
since we need to generate code for the concrete types.
Generating code for the concrete types
(i.e. emitting a copy of the code for each concrete type) is called <em>monomorphization</em>,
so the process of collecting all the concrete types is called <em>monomorphization collection</em>.</li>
<li>Next, we need to actually lower the MIR to a codegen IR
(usually LLVM IR) for each concrete type we collected.</li>
<li>Finally, we need to invoke the codegen backend,
which runs a bunch of optimization passes,
generates executable code,
and links together an executable binary.</li>
</ol>
<p>The code for codegen is actually a bit complex due to a few factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support for multiple codegen backends (LLVM, Cranelift, and GCC).
We try to share as much backend code between them as possible,
so a lot of it is generic over the codegen implementation.
This means that there are often a lot of layers of abstraction.</li>
<li>Codegen happens asynchronously in another thread for performance.</li>
<li>The actual codegen is done by a third-party library (either of the 3 backends).</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally, the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_codegen_ssa/index.html"><code>rustc_codegen_ssa</code></a> crate contains backend-agnostic code,
while the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_codegen_llvm/index.html"><code>rustc_codegen_llvm</code></a> crate contains code specific to LLVM codegen.</p>
<p>At a very high level, the entry point is
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_codegen_ssa/base/fn.codegen_crate.html"><code>rustc_codegen_ssa::base::codegen_crate</code></a>.
This function starts the process discussed in the rest of this chapter.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="mir-optimizations"><a class="header" href="#mir-optimizations">MIR optimizations</a></h1>
<p>MIR optimizations are optimizations run on the <a href="mir/../mir/index.html">MIR</a> to produce better MIR
before codegen. This is important for two reasons: first, it makes the final
generated executable code better, and second, it means that LLVM has less work
to do, so compilation is faster. Note that since MIR is generic (not
<a href="mir/../appendix/glossary.html#mono">monomorphized</a> yet), these optimizations are particularly
effective; we can optimize the generic version, so all of the monomorphizations
are cheaper!</p>
<p>MIR optimizations run after borrow checking. We run a series of optimization
passes over the MIR to improve it. Some passes are required to run on all code,
some passes don't actually do optimizations but only check stuff, and some
passes are only turned on in <code>release</code> mode.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_transform/fn.optimized_mir.html"><code>optimized_mir</code></a> <a href="mir/../query.html">query</a> is called to produce the optimized MIR
for a given <a href="mir/../appendix/glossary.html#def-id"><code>DefId</code></a>. This query makes sure that the borrow checker has
run and that some validation has occurred. Then, it <a href="mir/../mir/passes.html#stealing">steals</a> the MIR,
optimizes it, and returns the improved MIR.</p>
<h2 id="quickstart-for-adding-a-new-optimization"><a class="header" href="#quickstart-for-adding-a-new-optimization">Quickstart for adding a new optimization</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Make a Rust source file in <code>tests/mir-opt</code> that shows the code you want to
optimize. This should be kept simple, so avoid <code>println!</code> or other formatting
code if it's not necessary for the optimization. The reason for this is that
<code>println!</code>, <code>format!</code>, etc. generate a lot of MIR that can make it harder to
understand what the optimization does to the test.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run <code>./x.py test --bless tests/mir-opt/&lt;your-test&gt;.rs</code> to generate a MIR
dump. Read <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/tests/mir-opt/README.md">this README</a> for instructions on how to dump
things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Commit the current working directory state. The reason you should commit the
test output before you implement the optimization is so that you (and your
reviewers) can see a before/after diff of what the optimization changed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implement a new optimization in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/compiler/rustc_mir_transform/src"><code>compiler/rustc_mir_transform/src</code></a>.
The fastest and easiest way to do this is to</p>
<ol>
<li>pick a small optimization (such as <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/compiler/rustc_mir_transform/src/no_landing_pads.rs"><code>no_landing_pads</code></a>) and copy it
to a new file,</li>
<li>add your optimization to one of the lists in the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_transform/fn.run_optimization_passes.html"><code>run_optimization_passes()</code></a> function,</li>
<li>and then start modifying the copied optimization.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rerun <code>./x.py test --bless tests/mir-opt/&lt;your-test&gt;.rs</code> to regenerate the
MIR dumps. Look at the diffs to see if they are what you expect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run <code>./x.py test tests/ui</code> to see if your optimization broke anything.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there are issues with your optimization, experiment with it a bit and
repeat steps 5 and 6.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Commit and open a PR. You can do this at any point, even if things aren't
working yet, so that you can ask for feedback on the PR. Open a &quot;WIP&quot; PR
(just prefix your PR title with <code>[WIP]</code> or otherwise note that it is a
work in progress) in that case.</p>
<p>Make sure to commit the blessed test output as well! It's necessary for CI to
pass and it's very helpful to reviewers.</p>
</li>

<h2 id="defining-optimization-passes"><a class="header" href="#defining-optimization-passes">Defining optimization passes</a></h2>
<p>The list of passes run and the order in which they are run is defined by the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_transform/fn.run_optimization_passes.html"><code>run_optimization_passes</code></a> function. It contains an array of passes to
run.  Each pass in the array is a struct that implements the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/trait.MirPass.html"><code>MirPass</code></a> trait.
The array is an array of <code>&amp;dyn MirPass</code> trait objects. Typically, a pass is
implemented in its own module of the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_transform/index.html"><code>rustc_mir_transform</code></a> crate.</p>
<p>Some examples of passes are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>CleanupNonCodegenStatements</code>: remove some of the info that is only needed for
analyses, rather than codegen.</li>
<li><code>ConstProp</code>: Does <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constant_folding#Constant_propagation">constant propagation</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can see the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/trait.MirPass.html#implementors">&quot;Implementors&quot; section of the <code>MirPass</code> rustdocs</a> for more examples.</p>
<h2 id="mir-optimization-levels"><a class="header" href="#mir-optimization-levels">MIR optimization levels</a></h2>
<p>MIR optimizations can come in various levels of readiness. Experimental
optimizations may cause miscompilations, or slow down compile times.
These passes are still included in nightly builds to gather feedback and make it easier to modify
the pass. To enable working with slow or otherwise experimental optimization passes,
you can specify the <code>-Z mir-opt-level</code> debug flag. You can find the
definitions of the levels in the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/compiler-team/issues/319">compiler MCP</a>. If you are developing a MIR pass and
want to query whether your optimization pass should run, you can check the
current level using <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_session/config/struct.UnstableOptions.html#structfield.mir_opt_level"><code>tcx.sess.opts.unstable_opts.mir_opt_level</code></a>.</p>
<h2 id="optimization-fuel"><a class="header" href="#optimization-fuel">Optimization fuel</a></h2>
<p>Optimization fuel is a compiler option (<code>-Z fuel=&lt;crate&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</code>) that allows for fine grained
control over which optimizations can be applied during compilation: each optimization reduces
fuel by 1, and when fuel reaches 0 no more optimizations are applied. The primary use of fuel
is debugging optimizations that may be incorrect or misapplied. By changing the fuel
value, you can bisect a compilation session down to the exact incorrect optimization
(this behaves like a kind of binary search through the optimizations).</p>
<p>MIR optimizations respect fuel, and in general each pass should check fuel by calling
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/context/struct.TyCtxt.html#method.consider_optimizing"><code>tcx.consider_optimizing</code></a> and skipping the optimization if fuel
is empty. There are a few considerations:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the pass is considered &quot;guaranteed&quot; (for example, it should always be run because it is
needed for correctness), then fuel should not be used. An example of this is <code>PromoteTemps</code>.</li>
<li>In some cases, an initial pass is performed to gather candidates, which are then iterated to
perform optimizations. In these situations, we should allow for the initial gathering pass
and then check fuel as close to the mutation as possible. This allows for the best
debugging experience, because we can determine where in the list of candidates an optimization
may have been misapplied. Examples of this are <code>InstCombine</code> and <code>ConstantPropagation</code>.</li>
</ol>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="mir-debugging"><a class="header" href="#mir-debugging">MIR Debugging</a></h1>
<p>The <code>-Z dump-mir</code> flag can be used to dump a text representation of the MIR.
The following optional flags, used in combination with <code>-Z dump-mir</code>, enable
additional output formats, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-Z dump-mir-graphviz</code> - dumps a <code>.dot</code> file that represents MIR as a
control-flow graph</li>
<li><code>-Z dump-mir-dataflow</code> - dumps a <code>.dot</code> file showing the <a href="mir/./dataflow.html#graphviz-diagrams">dataflow state</a> at
each point in the control-flow graph</li>
<li><code>-Z dump-mir-spanview</code> - dumps an <code>.html</code> file that highlights the source
spans associated with MIR elements (including mouse-over actions to reveal
elements obscured by overlaps, and tooltips to view the MIR statements).
This flag takes an optional value: <code>statement</code> (the default), <code>terminator</code>, or
<code>block</code>, to generate span highlights with different levels of granularity.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>-Z dump-mir=F</code> is a handy compiler options that will let you view the MIR for
each function at each stage of compilation. <code>-Z dump-mir</code> takes a <strong>filter</strong> <code>F</code>
which allows you to control which functions and which passes you are
interesting in. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">&gt; rustc -Z dump-mir=foo ...
</code></pre>
<p>This will dump the MIR for any function whose name contains <code>foo</code>; it
will dump the MIR both before and after every pass. Those files will
be created in the <code>mir_dump</code> directory. There will likely be quite a
lot of them!</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">&gt; cat &gt; foo.rs
fn main() {
    println!(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
}
^D
&gt; rustc -Z dump-mir=main foo.rs
&gt; ls mir_dump/* | wc -l
     161
</code></pre>
<p>The files have names like <code>rustc.main.000-000.CleanEndRegions.after.mir</code>. These
names have a number of parts:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">rustc.main.000-000.CleanEndRegions.after.mir
      ---- --- --- --------------- ----- either before or after
      |    |   |   name of the pass
      |    |   index of dump within the pass (usually 0, but some passes dump intermediate states)
      |    index of the pass
      def-path to the function etc being dumped
</code></pre>
<p>You can also make more selective filters. For example, <code>main &amp; CleanEndRegions</code>
will select for things that reference <em>both</em> <code>main</code> and the pass
<code>CleanEndRegions</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">&gt; rustc -Z dump-mir='main &amp; CleanEndRegions' foo.rs
&gt; ls mir_dump
rustc.main.000-000.CleanEndRegions.after.mir	rustc.main.000-000.CleanEndRegions.before.mir
</code></pre>
<!--- TODO: Change NoLandingPads. [#1232](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc-dev-guide/issues/1232) -->
<p>Filters can also have <code>|</code> parts to combine multiple sets of
<code>&amp;</code>-filters. For example <code>main &amp; CleanEndRegions | main &amp; NoLandingPads</code> will select <em>either</em> <code>main</code> and <code>CleanEndRegions</code> <em>or</em>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="constant-evaluation"><a class="header" href="#constant-evaluation">Constant Evaluation</a></h1>
<p>Constant evaluation is the process of computing values at compile time. For a
specific item (constant/static/array length) this happens after the MIR for the
item is borrow-checked and optimized. In many cases trying to const evaluate an
item will trigger the computation of its MIR for the first time.</p>
<p>Prominent examples are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The initializer of a <code>static</code></li>
<li>Array length
<ul>
<li>needs to be known to reserve stack or heap space</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Enum variant discriminants
<ul>
<li>needs to be known to prevent two variants from having the same
discriminant</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Patterns
<ul>
<li>need to be known to check for overlapping patterns</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally constant evaluation can be used to reduce the workload or binary
size at runtime by precomputing complex operations at compiletime and only
storing the result.</p>
<p>All uses of constant evaluation can either be categorized as &quot;influencing the type system&quot;
(array lengths, enum variant discriminants, const generic parameters), or as solely being
done to precompute expressions to be used at runtime.</p>
<p>Constant evaluation can be done by calling the <code>const_eval_*</code> functions of <code>TyCtxt</code>.
They're the wrappers of the <code>const_eval</code> query.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>const_eval_global_id_for_typeck</code> evaluates a constant to a valtree,
so the result value can be further inspected by the compiler.</li>
<li><code>const_eval_global_id</code> evaluate a constant to an &quot;opaque blob&quot; containing its final value;
this is only useful for codegen backends and the CTFE evaluator engine itself.</li>
<li><code>eval_static_initializer</code> specifically computes the initial values of a static.
Statics are special; all other functions do not represent statics correctly
and have thus assertions preventing their use on statics.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>const_eval_*</code> functions use a <a href="./param_env.html"><code>ParamEnv</code></a> of environment
in which the constant is evaluated (e.g. the function within which the constant is used)
and a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/interpret/struct.GlobalId.html"><code>GlobalId</code></a>. The <code>GlobalId</code> is made up of an <code>Instance</code> referring to a constant
or static or of an <code>Instance</code> of a function and an index into the function's <code>Promoted</code> table.</p>
<p>Constant evaluation returns an <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/interpret/error/type.EvalToValTreeResult.html"><code>EvalToValTreeResult</code></a> for type system constants or
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/interpret/error/type.EvalToConstValueResult.html"><code>EvalToConstValueResult</code></a> with either the error, or a representation of the constant.</p>
<p>Constants for the type system are encoded in &quot;valtree representation&quot;. The <code>ValTree</code> datastructure
allows us to represent</p>
<ul>
<li>arrays,</li>
<li>many structs,</li>
<li>tuples,</li>
<li>enums and,</li>
<li>most primitives.</li>
</ul>
<p>The basic rule for
being permitted in the type system is that every value must be uniquely represented. In other
words: a specific value must only be representable in one specific way. For example: there is only
one way to represent an array of two integers as a <code>ValTree</code>:
<code>ValTree::Branch(&amp;[ValTree::Leaf(first_int), ValTree;:Leaf(second_int)])</code>.
Even though theoretically a <code>[u32; 2]</code> could be encoded in a <code>u64</code> and thus just be a
<code>ValTree::Leaf(bits_of_two_u32)</code>, that is not a legal construction of <code>ValTree</code>
(and is very complex to do, so it is unlikely anyone is tempted to do so).</p>
<p>These rules also mean that some values are not representable. There can be no <code>union</code>s in type
level constants, as it is not clear how they should be represented, because their active variant
is unknown. Similarly there is no way to represent raw pointers, as addresses are unknown at
compile-time and thus we cannot make any assumptions about them. References on the other hand
<em>can</em> be represented, as equality for references is defined as equality on their value, so we
ignore their address and just look at the backing value. We must make sure that the pointer values
of the references are not observable at compile time. We thus encode <code>&amp;42</code> exactly like <code>42</code>.
Any conversion from
valtree back to codegen constants must reintroduce an actual indirection. At codegen time the
addresses may be deduplicated between multiple uses or not, entirely depending on arbitrary
optimization choices.</p>
<p>As a consequence, all decoding of <code>ValTree</code> must happen by matching on the type first and making
decisions depending on that. The value itself gives no useful information without the type that
belongs to it.</p>
<p>Other constants get represented as <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/interpret/value/enum.ConstValue.html#variant.Scalar"><code>ConstValue::Scalar</code></a> or
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/interpret/value/enum.ConstValue.html#variant.Slice"><code>ConstValue::Slice</code></a> if possible. These values are only useful outside the
compile-time interpreter. If you need the value of a constant during
interpretation, you need to directly work with <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_const_eval/interpret/struct.InterpCx.html#method.const_to_op"><code>const_to_op</code></a>.</p>

<p>The interpreter is a virtual machine for executing MIR without compiling to
machine code. It is usually invoked via <code>tcx.const_eval_*</code> functions. The
interpreter is shared between the compiler (for compile-time function
evaluation, CTFE) and the tool <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/miri/">Miri</a>, which
uses the same virtual machine to detect Undefined Behavior in (unsafe) Rust
code.</p>
<p>If you start out with a constant:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>const FOO: usize = 1 &lt;&lt; 12;
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>rustc doesn't actually invoke anything until the constant is either used or
placed into metadata.</p>
<p>Once you have a use-site like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">type Foo = [u8; FOO - 42];
</code></pre>
<p>The compiler needs to figure out the length of the array before being able to
create items that use the type (locals, constants, function arguments, ...).</p>
<p>To obtain the (in this case empty) parameter environment, one can call
<code>let param_env = tcx.param_env(length_def_id);</code>. The <code>GlobalId</code> needed is</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">let gid = GlobalId {
    promoted: None,
    instance: Instance::mono(length_def_id),
};
</code></pre>
<p>Invoking <code>tcx.const_eval(param_env.and(gid))</code> will now trigger the creation of
the MIR of the array length expression. The MIR will look something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-mir">Foo::{{constant}}#0: usize = {
    let mut _0: usize;
    let mut _1: (usize, bool);

    bb0: {
        _1 = CheckedSub(const FOO, const 42usize);
        assert(!move (_1.1: bool), &quot;attempt to subtract with overflow&quot;) -&gt; bb1;
    }

    bb1: {
        _0 = move (_1.0: usize);
        return;
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Before the evaluation, a virtual memory location (in this case essentially a
<code>vec![u8; 4]</code> or <code>vec![u8; 8]</code>) is created for storing the evaluation result.</p>
<p>At the start of the evaluation, <code>_0</code> and <code>_1</code> are
<code>Operand::Immediate(Immediate::Scalar(ScalarMaybeUndef::Undef))</code>. This is quite
a mouthful: <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_const_eval/interpret/enum.Operand.html"><code>Operand</code></a> can represent either data stored somewhere in the
<a href="const-eval/interpret.html#memory">interpreter memory</a> (<code>Operand::Indirect</code>), or (as an optimization)
immediate data stored in-line.  And <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_const_eval/interpret/enum.Immediate.html"><code>Immediate</code></a> can either be a single
(potentially uninitialized) <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/interpret/enum.Scalar.html">scalar value</a> (integer or thin pointer),
or a pair of two of them. In our case, the single scalar value is <em>not</em> (yet)
initialized.</p>
<p>When the initialization of <code>_1</code> is invoked, the value of the <code>FOO</code> constant is
required, and triggers another call to <code>tcx.const_eval_*</code>, which will not be shown
here. If the evaluation of FOO is successful, <code>42</code> will be subtracted from its
value <code>4096</code> and the result stored in <code>_1</code> as
<code>Operand::Immediate(Immediate::ScalarPair(Scalar::Raw { data: 4054, .. }, Scalar::Raw { data: 0, .. })</code>. The first part of the pair is the computed value,
the second part is a bool that's true if an overflow happened. A <code>Scalar::Raw</code>
also stores the size (in bytes) of this scalar value; we are eliding that here.</p>
<p>The next statement asserts that said boolean is <code>0</code>. In case the assertion
fails, its error message is used for reporting a compile-time error.</p>
<p>Since it does not fail, <code>Operand::Immediate(Immediate::Scalar(Scalar::Raw { data: 4054, .. }))</code> is stored in the virtual memory was allocated before the
evaluation. <code>_0</code> always refers to that location directly.</p>
<p>After the evaluation is done, the return value is converted from <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_const_eval/interpret/enum.Operand.html"><code>Operand</code></a> to
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/interpret/enum.ConstValue.html"><code>ConstValue</code></a> by <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_const_eval/const_eval/eval_queries/fn.op_to_const.html"><code>op_to_const</code></a>: the former representation is geared towards
what is needed <em>during</em> const evaluation, while <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/interpret/enum.ConstValue.html"><code>ConstValue</code></a> is shaped by the
needs of the remaining parts of the compiler that consume the results of const
evaluation.  As part of this conversion, for types with scalar values, even if
the resulting <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_const_eval/interpret/enum.Operand.html"><code>Operand</code></a> is <code>Indirect</code>, it will return an immediate
<code>ConstValue::Scalar(computed_value)</code> (instead of the usual <code>ConstValue::ByRef</code>).
This makes using the result much more efficient and also more convenient, as no
further queries need to be executed in order to get at something as simple as a
<code>usize</code>.</p>
<p>Future evaluations of the same constants will not actually invoke
the interpreter, but just use the cached result.</p>
<h2 id="datastructures"><a class="header" href="#datastructures">Datastructures</a></h2>
<p>The interpreter's outside-facing datastructures can be found in
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/compiler/rustc_middle/src/mir/interpret">rustc_middle/src/mir/interpret</a>.
This is mainly the error enum and the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/interpret/enum.ConstValue.html"><code>ConstValue</code></a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/interpret/enum.Scalar.html"><code>Scalar</code></a> types. A
<code>ConstValue</code> can be either <code>Scalar</code> (a single <code>Scalar</code>, i.e., integer or thin
pointer), <code>Slice</code> (to represent byte slices and strings, as needed for pattern
matching) or <code>ByRef</code>, which is used for anything else and refers to a virtual
allocation. These allocations can be accessed via the methods on
<code>tcx.interpret_interner</code>.  A <code>Scalar</code> is either some <code>Raw</code> integer or a pointer;
see <a href="const-eval/interpret.html#memory">the next section</a> for more on that.</p>
<p>If you are expecting a numeric result, you can use <code>eval_usize</code> (panics on
anything that can't be represented as a <code>u64</code>) or <code>try_eval_usize</code> which results
in an <code>Option&lt;u64&gt;</code> yielding the <code>Scalar</code> if possible.</p>
<h2 id="memory"><a class="header" href="#memory">Memory</a></h2>
<p>To support any kind of pointers, the interpreter needs to have a &quot;virtual memory&quot; that the
pointers can point to.  This is implemented in the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_const_eval/interpret/struct.Memory.html"><code>Memory</code></a> type.  In the
simplest model, every global variable, stack variable and every dynamic
allocation corresponds to an <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/interpret/struct.Allocation.html"><code>Allocation</code></a> in that memory.  (Actually using an
allocation for every MIR stack variable would be very inefficient; that's why we
have <code>Operand::Immediate</code> for stack variables that are both small and never have
their address taken.  But that is purely an optimization.)</p>
<p>Such an <code>Allocation</code> is basically just a sequence of <code>u8</code> storing the value of
each byte in this allocation.  (Plus some extra data, see below.)  Every
<code>Allocation</code> has a globally unique <code>AllocId</code> assigned in <code>Memory</code>.  With that, a
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/interpret/struct.Pointer.html"><code>Pointer</code></a> consists of a pair of an <code>AllocId</code> (indicating the allocation) and
an offset into the allocation (indicating which byte of the allocation the
pointer points to).  It may seem odd that a <code>Pointer</code> is not just an integer
address, but remember that during const evaluation, we cannot know at which
actual integer address the allocation will end up -- so we use <code>AllocId</code> as
symbolic base addresses, which means we need a separate offset.  (As an aside,
it turns out that pointers at run-time are
<a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/unsafe-code-guidelines/glossary.html#pointer-provenance">more than just integers, too</a>.)</p>
<p>These allocations exist so that references and raw pointers have something to
point to. There is no global linear heap in which things are allocated, but each
allocation (be it for a local variable, a static or a (future) heap allocation)
gets its own little memory with exactly the required size. So if you have a
pointer to an allocation for a local variable <code>a</code>, there is no possible (no
matter how unsafe) operation that you can do that would ever change said pointer
to a pointer to a different local variable <code>b</code>.
Pointer arithmetic on <code>a</code> will only ever change its offset; the <code>AllocId</code> stays the same.</p>
<p>This, however, causes a problem when we want to store a <code>Pointer</code> into an
<code>Allocation</code>: we cannot turn it into a sequence of <code>u8</code> of the right length!
<code>AllocId</code> and offset together are twice as big as a pointer &quot;seems&quot; to be.  This
is what the <code>relocation</code> field of <code>Allocation</code> is for: the byte offset of the
<code>Pointer</code> gets stored as a bunch of <code>u8</code>, while its <code>AllocId</code> gets stored
out-of-band.  The two are reassembled when the <code>Pointer</code> is read from memory.
The other bit of extra data an <code>Allocation</code> needs is <code>undef_mask</code> for keeping
track of which of its bytes are initialized.</p>
<h3 id="global-memory-and-exotic-allocations"><a class="header" href="#global-memory-and-exotic-allocations">Global memory and exotic allocations</a></h3>
<p><code>Memory</code> exists only during evaluation; it gets destroyed when the
final value of the constant is computed.  In case that constant contains any
pointers, those get &quot;interned&quot; and moved to a global &quot;const eval memory&quot; that is
part of <code>TyCtxt</code>.  These allocations stay around for the remaining computation
and get serialized into the final output (so that dependent crates can use
them).</p>
<p>Moreover, to also support function pointers, the global memory in <code>TyCtxt</code> can
also contain &quot;virtual allocations&quot;: instead of an <code>Allocation</code>, these contain an
<code>Instance</code>.  That allows a <code>Pointer</code> to point to either normal data or a
function, which is needed to be able to evaluate casts from function pointers to
raw pointers.</p>
<p>Finally, the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/interpret/enum.GlobalAlloc.html"><code>GlobalAlloc</code></a> type used in the global memory also contains a
variant <code>Static</code> that points to a particular <code>const</code> or <code>static</code> item.  This is
needed to support circular statics, where we need to have a <code>Pointer</code> to a
<code>static</code> for which we cannot yet have an <code>Allocation</code> as we do not know the
bytes of its value.</p>
<h3 id="pointer-values-vs-pointer-types"><a class="header" href="#pointer-values-vs-pointer-types">Pointer values vs Pointer types</a></h3>
<p>One common cause of confusion in the interpreter is that being a pointer <em>value</em> and having
a pointer <em>type</em> are entirely independent properties.  By &quot;pointer value&quot;, we
refer to a <code>Scalar::Ptr</code> containing a <code>Pointer</code> and thus pointing somewhere into
the interpreter's virtual memory.  This is in contrast to <code>Scalar::Raw</code>, which is just some
concrete integer.</p>
<p>However, a variable of pointer or reference <em>type</em>, such as <code>*const T</code> or <code>&amp;T</code>,
does not have to have a pointer <em>value</em>: it could be obtained by casting or
transmuting an integer to a pointer. 
And similarly, when casting or transmuting a reference to some
actual allocation to an integer, we end up with a pointer <em>value</em>
(<code>Scalar::Ptr</code>) at integer <em>type</em> (<code>usize</code>).  This is a problem because we
cannot meaningfully perform integer operations such as division on pointer
values.</p>
<h2 id="interpretation"><a class="header" href="#interpretation">Interpretation</a></h2>
<p>Although the main entry point to constant evaluation is the <code>tcx.const_eval_*</code>
functions, there are additional functions in
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_const_eval/index.html">rustc_const_eval/src/const_eval</a>
that allow accessing the fields of a <code>ConstValue</code> (<code>ByRef</code> or otherwise). You should
never have to access an <code>Allocation</code> directly except for translating it to the
compilation target (at the moment just LLVM).</p>
<p>The interpreter starts by creating a virtual stack frame for the current constant that is
being evaluated. There's essentially no difference between a constant and a
function with no arguments, except that constants do not allow local (named)
variables at the time of writing this guide.</p>
<p>A stack frame is defined by the <code>Frame</code> type in
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/compiler/rustc_const_eval/src/interpret/eval_context.rs">rustc_const_eval/src/interpret/eval_context.rs</a>
and contains all the local
variables memory (<code>None</code> at the start of evaluation). Each frame refers to the
evaluation of either the root constant or subsequent calls to <code>const fn</code>. The
evaluation of another constant simply calls <code>tcx.const_eval_*</code>, which produce an
entirely new and independent stack frame.</p>
<p>The frames are just a <code>Vec&lt;Frame&gt;</code>, there's no way to actually refer to a
<code>Frame</code>'s memory even if horrible shenanigans are done via unsafe code. The only
memory that can be referred to are <code>Allocation</code>s.</p>
<p>The interpreter now calls the <code>step</code> method (in
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/compiler/rustc_const_eval/src/interpret/step.rs">rustc_const_eval/src/interpret/step.rs</a>
) until it either returns an error or has no further statements to execute. Each
statement will now initialize or modify the locals or the virtual memory
referred to by a local. This might require evaluating other constants or
statics, which just recursively invokes <code>tcx.const_eval_*</code>.</p>

<p>As you probably know, Rust has a very expressive type system that has extensive
support for generic types. But of course, assembly is not generic, so we need
to figure out the concrete types of all the generics before the code can
execute.</p>
<p>Different languages handle this problem differently. For example, in some
languages, such as Java, we may not know the most precise type of value until
runtime. In the case of Java, this is ok because (almost) all variables are
reference values anyway (i.e. pointers to a heap allocated object). This
flexibility comes at the cost of performance, since all accesses to an object
must dereference a pointer.</p>
<p>Rust takes a different approach: it <em>monomorphizes</em> all generic types. This
means that compiler stamps out a different copy of the code of a generic
function for each concrete type needed. For example, if I use a <code>Vec&lt;u64&gt;</code> and
a <code>Vec&lt;String&gt;</code> in my code, then the generated binary will have two copies of
the generated code for <code>Vec</code>: one for <code>Vec&lt;u64&gt;</code> and another for <code>Vec&lt;String&gt;</code>.
The result is fast programs, but it comes at the cost of compile time (creating
all those copies can take a while) and binary size (all those copies might take
a lot of space).</p>
<p>Monomorphization is the first step in the backend of the Rust compiler.</p>
<h2 id="collection"><a class="header" href="#collection">Collection</a></h2>
<p>First, we need to figure out what concrete types we need for all the generic
things in our program. This is called <em>collection</em>, and the code that does this
is called the <em>monomorphization collector</em>.</p>
<p>Take this example:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn banana() {
   peach::&lt;u64&gt;();
}

fn main() {
    banana();
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>The monomorphization collector will give you a list of <code>[main, banana, peach::&lt;u64&gt;]</code>. These are the functions that will have machine code generated
for them. Collector will also add things like statics to that list.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_monomorphize/collector/index.html">the collector rustdocs</a> for more info.</p>
<p>The monomorphization collector is run just before MIR lowering and codegen.

<p>For better incremental build times, the CGU partitioner creates two CGU for each source level
modules. One is for &quot;stable&quot; i.e. non-generic code and the other is more volatile code i.e.
monomorphized/specialized instances.</p>
<p>For dependencies, consider Crate A and Crate B, such that Crate B depends on Crate A.

<h2 id="polymorphization"><a class="header" href="#polymorphization">Polymorphization</a></h2>
<p>As mentioned above, monomorphization produces fast code, but it comes at the
cost of compile time and binary size. <a href="backend/../mir/optimizations.html">MIR optimizations</a> can help a
bit with this.</p>
<p>In addition to MIR optimizations, rustc attempts to determine when fewer
copies of functions are necessary and avoid making those copies - known
as &quot;polymorphization&quot;. When a function-like item is found during
monomorphization collection, the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_monomorphize/polymorphize/fn.unused_generic_params.html"><code>rustc_mir_monomorphize::polymorphize::unused_generic_params</code></a>
query is invoked, which traverses the MIR of the item to determine on which
generic parameters the item might not need duplicated.</p>
<p>Currently, polymorphization only looks for unused generic parameters. These
are relatively rare in functions, but closures inherit the generic
parameters of their parent function and it is common for closures to not
use those inherited parameters. Without polymorphization, a copy of these
closures would be created for each copy of the parent function. By
creating fewer copies, less LLVM IR is generated and needs processed.</p>
<p><code>unused_generic_params</code> returns a <code>FiniteBitSet&lt;u64&gt;</code> where a bit is set if
the generic parameter of the corresponding index is unused. Any parameters
after the first sixty-four are considered used.</p>
<p>The results of polymorphization analysis are used in the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/instance/struct.Instance.html#method.polymorphize"><code>Instance::polymorphize</code></a> function to replace the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/instance/struct.Instance.html"><code>Instance</code></a>'s substitutions for the unused generic parameters with their
identity substitutions.</p>
<p>Consider the example below:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn foo&lt;A, B&gt;() {
    let x: Option&lt;B&gt; = None;
}

fn main() {
    foo::&lt;u16, u32&gt;();
    foo::&lt;u64, u32&gt;();
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>During monomorphization collection, <code>foo</code> will be collected with the
substitutions <code>[u16, u32]</code> and <code>[u64, u32]</code> (from its invocations in <code>main</code>).
<code>foo</code> has the identity substitutions <code>[A, B]</code> (or
<code>[ty::Param(0), ty::Param(1)]</code>).</p>
<p>Polymorphization will identify <code>A</code> as being unused and it will be replaced in
the substitutions with the identity parameter before being added to the set
of collected items - thereby reducing the copies from two (<code>[u16, u32]</code> and
<code>[u64, u32]</code>) to one (<code>[A, u32]</code>).</p>
<p><code>unused_generic_params</code> will also invoked during code generation when the
symbol name for <code>foo</code> is being computed for use in the callsites of <code>foo</code>
(which have the regular substitutions present, otherwise there would be a
symbol mismatch between the caller and the function).</p>
<p>As a result of polymorphization, items collected during monomorphization
cannot be assumed to be monomorphic.</p>
<p>It is intended that polymorphization be extended to more advanced cases,
such as where only the size/alignment of a generic parameter are required.</p>
<p>More details on polymorphization are available in the
<a href="https://davidtw.co/media/masters_dissertation.pdf">master's thesis</a> associated with polymorphization's initial
implementation.</p>

<p>Now that we have a list of symbols to generate from the collector, we need to
generate some sort of codegen IR. In this chapter, we will assume LLVM IR,
since that's what rustc usually uses. The actual monomorphization is performed
as we go, while we do the translation.</p>
<p>Recall that the backend is started by
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_codegen_ssa/base/fn.codegen_crate.html"><code>rustc_codegen_ssa::base::codegen_crate</code></a>. Eventually, this reaches
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_codegen_ssa/mir/fn.codegen_mir.html"><code>rustc_codegen_ssa::mir::codegen_mir</code></a>, which does the lowering from
MIR to LLVM IR.</p>
<p>The code is split into modules which handle particular MIR primitives:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_codegen_ssa/mir/block/index.html"><code>rustc_codegen_ssa::mir::block</code></a> will deal with translating
blocks and their terminators.  The most complicated and also the most
interesting thing this module does is generating code for function calls,
including the necessary unwinding handling IR.</li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_codegen_ssa/mir/statement/index.html"><code>rustc_codegen_ssa::mir::statement</code></a> translates MIR statements.</li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_codegen_ssa/mir/operand/index.html"><code>rustc_codegen_ssa::mir::operand</code></a> translates MIR operands.</li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_codegen_ssa/mir/place/index.html"><code>rustc_codegen_ssa::mir::place</code></a> translates MIR place references.</li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_codegen_ssa/mir/rvalue/index.html"><code>rustc_codegen_ssa::mir::rvalue</code></a> translates MIR r-values.</li>
</ul>
<p>Before a function is translated a number of simple and primitive analysis
passes will run to help us generate simpler and more efficient LLVM IR. An
example of such an analysis pass would be figuring out which variables are
SSA-like, so that we can translate them to SSA directly rather than relying on
LLVM's <code>mem2reg</code> for those variables. The analysis can be found in
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_codegen_ssa/mir/analyze/index.html"><code>rustc_codegen_ssa::mir::analyze</code></a>.</p>
<p>Usually a single MIR basic block will map to a LLVM basic block, with very few
exceptions: intrinsic or function calls and less basic MIR statements like
<code>assert</code> can result in multiple basic blocks. This is a perfect lede into the
non-portable LLVM-specific part of the code generation. Intrinsic generation is
fairly easy to understand as it involves very few abstraction levels in between
and can be found in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_codegen_llvm/intrinsic/index.html"><code>rustc_codegen_llvm::intrinsic</code></a>.</p>
<p>Everything else will use the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_codegen_llvm/builder/index.html">builder interface</a>. This is the code that gets
called in the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_codegen_ssa/mir/index.html"><code>rustc_codegen_ssa::mir::*</code></a> modules discussed above.</p>

<p>Code generation (or &quot;codegen&quot;) is the part of the compiler
that actually generates an executable binary.
Usually, rustc uses LLVM for code generation,
but there is also support for <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/tree/main/cranelift">Cranelift</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc">GCC</a>.
The key is that rustc doesn't implement codegen itself.
It's worth noting, though, that in the Rust source code,
many parts of the backend have <code>codegen</code> in their names
(there are no hard boundaries).</p>

<h2 id="what-is-llvm"><a class="header" href="#what-is-llvm">What is LLVM?</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://llvm.org">LLVM</a> is &quot;a collection of modular and reusable compiler and
toolchain technologies&quot;. In particular, the LLVM project contains a pluggable
compiler backend (also called &quot;LLVM&quot;), which is used by many compiler projects,
including the <code>clang</code> C compiler and our beloved <code>rustc</code>.</p>
<p>LLVM takes input in the form of LLVM IR. It is basically assembly code with
additional low-level types and annotations added. These annotations are helpful
for doing optimizations on the LLVM IR and outputted machine code. The end
result of all this is (at long last) something executable (e.g. an ELF object,
an EXE, or wasm).</p>
<p>There are a few benefits to using LLVM:</p>
<ul>
<li>We don't have to write a whole compiler backend. This reduces implementation
and maintenance burden.</li>
<li>We benefit from the large suite of advanced optimizations that the LLVM
project has been collecting.</li>
<li>We can automatically compile Rust to any of the platforms for which LLVM has
support. For example, as soon as LLVM added support for wasm, voila! rustc,
clang, and a bunch of other languages were able to compile to wasm! (Well,
there was some extra stuff to be done, but we were 90% there anyway).</li>
<li>We and other compiler projects benefit from each other. For example, when the
<a href="https://meltdownattack.com/">Spectre and Meltdown security vulnerabilities</a> were discovered,
only LLVM needed to be patched.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="running-llvm-linking-and-metadata-generation"><a class="header" href="#running-llvm-linking-and-metadata-generation">Running LLVM, linking, and metadata generation</a></h2>
<p>Once LLVM IR for all of the functions and statics, etc is built, it is time to
start running LLVM and its optimization passes. LLVM IR is grouped into
&quot;modules&quot;. Multiple &quot;modules&quot; can be codegened at the same time to aid in
multi-core utilization. These &quot;modules&quot; are what we refer to as <em>codegen
units</em>. These units were established way back during monomorphization
collection phase.</p>
<p>Once LLVM produces objects from these modules, these objects are passed to the
linker along with, optionally, the metadata object and an archive or an
executable is produced.</p>
<p>It is not necessarily the codegen phase described above that runs the
optimizations. With certain kinds of LTO, the optimization might happen at the
linking time instead. It is also possible for some optimizations to happen
before objects are passed on to the linker and some to happen during the
linking.</p>
<p>This all happens towards the very end of compilation. The code for this can be
found in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_codegen_ssa/back/index.html"><code>rustc_codegen_ssa::back</code></a> and
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_codegen_llvm/back/index.html"><code>rustc_codegen_llvm::back</code></a>. Sadly, this piece of code is not
really well-separated into LLVM-dependent code; the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_codegen_ssa/index.html"><code>rustc_codegen_ssa</code></a>
contains a fair amount of code specific to the LLVM backend.</p>
<p>Once these components are done with their work you end up with a number of
files in your filesystem corresponding to the outputs you have requested.</p>

<!-- date-check: Aug 2022 -->
<p>There is no formal policy about when to update LLVM or what it can be updated to,
but a few guidelines are applied:</p>
<ul>
<li>We try to always support the latest released version</li>
<li>We try to support the last few versions
(and the number changes over time)</li>
<li>We allow moving to arbitrary commits during development</li>
<li>We strongly prefer to upstream all patches to LLVM before including them in rustc</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-update-llvm"><a class="header" href="#why-update-llvm">Why update LLVM?</a></h2>
<p>There are two reasons we would want to update LLVM:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A bug could have been fixed! Often we find bugs in the compiler and fix
them upstream in LLVM. We'll want to pull fixes back to the compiler itself as
they're merged upstream.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LLVM itself may have a new release.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these reasons has a different strategy for updating LLVM, and we'll go
over them in detail here.</p>
<h2 id="bugfix-updates"><a class="header" href="#bugfix-updates">Bugfix Updates</a></h2>
<p>For updates of LLVM that are to fix a small bug, we cherry-pick the bugfix to
the branch we're already using. The steps for this are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure the bugfix is in upstream LLVM.</li>
<li>Identify the branch that rustc is currently using. The <code>src/llvm-project</code>
submodule is always pinned to a branch of the
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/llvm-project">rust-lang/llvm-project repository</a>.</li>
<li>Fork the rust-lang/llvm-project repository</li>
<li>Check out the appropriate branch (typically named <code>rustc/a.b-yyyy-mm-dd</code>)</li>
<li>Cherry-pick the upstream commit onto the branch</li>
<li>Push this branch to your fork</li>
<li>Send a Pull Request to rust-lang/llvm-project to the same branch as before.
Be sure to reference the Rust and/or LLVM issue that you're fixing in the PR
description.</li>
<li>Wait for the PR to be merged</li>
<li>Send a PR to rust-lang/rust updating the <code>src/llvm-project</code> submodule with
your bugfix. This can be done locally with <code>git submodule update --remote src/llvm-project</code> typically.</li>
<li>Wait for PR to be merged</li>
</ol>
<p>An example PR:

<h2 id="new-llvm-release-updates"><a class="header" href="#new-llvm-release-updates">New LLVM Release Updates</a></h2>
<!-- date-check: Aug 2022 -->
<p>Unlike bugfixes,
updating to a new release of LLVM typically requires a lot more work.
This is where we can't reasonably cherry-pick commits backwards,
so we need to do a full update.
There's a lot of stuff to do here,
so let's go through each in detail.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>LLVM announces that its latest release version has branched.
This will show up as a branch in the <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project">llvm/llvm-project repository</a>,
typically named <code>release/$N.x</code>,
where <code>$N</code> is the version of LLVM that's being released.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a new branch in the <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/llvm-project">rust-lang/llvm-project repository</a>
from this <code>release/$N.x</code> branch,
and name it <code>rustc/a.b-yyyy-mm-dd</code>,
where <code>a.b</code> is the current version number of LLVM in-tree
at the time of the branch,
and the remaining part is the current date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apply Rust-specific patches to the llvm-project repository.
All features and bugfixes are upstream,
but there's often some weird build-related patches
that don't make sense to upstream.
These patches are typically the latest patches in the
rust-lang/llvm-project branch that rustc is currently using.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build the new LLVM in the <code>rust</code> repository.
To do this,
you'll want to update the <code>src/llvm-project</code> repository to your branch,
and the revision you've created.
It's also typically a good idea to update <code>.gitmodules</code> with the new
branch name of the LLVM submodule.
Make sure you've committed changes to
<code>src/llvm-project</code> to ensure submodule updates aren't reverted.
Some commands you should execute are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>./x.py build src/llvm</code> - test that LLVM still builds</li>
<li><code>./x.py build src/tools/lld</code> - same for LLD</li>
<li><code>./x.py build</code> - build the rest of rustc</li>
</ul>
<p>You'll likely need to update <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/compiler/rustc_llvm/llvm-wrapper"><code>llvm-wrapper/*.cpp</code></a>
to compile with updated LLVM bindings.
Note that you should use <code>#ifdef</code> and such to ensure
that the bindings still compile on older LLVM versions.</p>
<p>Note that <code>profile = &quot;compiler&quot;</code> and other defaults set by <code>./x.py setup</code>
download LLVM from CI instead of building it from source.
You should disable this temporarily to make sure your changes are being used.
This is done by having the following setting in <code>config.toml</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[llvm]
download-ci-llvm = false
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Test for regressions across other platforms. LLVM often has at least one bug
for non-tier-1 architectures, so it's good to do some more testing before
sending this to bors! If you're low on resources you can send the PR as-is
now to bors, though, and it'll get tested anyway.</p>
<p>Ideally, build LLVM and test it on a few platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux</li>
<li>macOS</li>
<li>Windows</li>
</ul>
<p>Afterwards, run some docker containers that CI also does:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>./src/ci/docker/run.sh wasm32</code></li>
<li><code>./src/ci/docker/run.sh arm-android</code></li>
<li><code>./src/ci/docker/run.sh dist-various-1</code></li>
<li><code>./src/ci/docker/run.sh dist-various-2</code></li>
<li><code>./src/ci/docker/run.sh armhf-gnu</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prepare a PR to <code>rust-lang/rust</code>. Work with maintainers of
<code>rust-lang/llvm-project</code> to get your commit in a branch of that repository,
and then you can send a PR to <code>rust-lang/rust</code>. You'll change at least
<code>src/llvm-project</code> and will likely also change <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/compiler/rustc_llvm/llvm-wrapper"><code>llvm-wrapper</code></a> as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For prior art, here are some previous LLVM updates:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/73526">LLVM 11</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/81451">LLVM 12</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/87570">LLVM 13</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/93577">LLVM 14</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/99464">LLVM 15</a></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that sometimes it's easiest to land <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/compiler/rustc_llvm/llvm-wrapper"><code>llvm-wrapper</code></a> compatibility as a PR
before actually updating <code>src/llvm-project</code>.
This way,
while you're working through LLVM issues,
others interested in trying out the new LLVM can benefit from work you've done
to update the C++ bindings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Over the next few months,
LLVM will continually push commits to its <code>release/a.b</code> branch.
We will often want to have those bug fixes as well.
The merge process for that is to use <code>git merge</code> itself to merge LLVM's
<code>release/a.b</code> branch with the branch created in step 2.
This is typically
done multiple times when necessary while LLVM's release branch is baking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LLVM then announces the release of version <code>a.b</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After LLVM's official release,
we follow the process of creating a new branch on the
rust-lang/llvm-project repository again,
this time with a new date.
It is only then that the PR to update Rust to use that version is merged.</p>
<p>The commit history of <code>rust-lang/llvm-project</code>
should look much cleaner as a <code>git rebase</code> is done,
where just a few Rust-specific commits are stacked on top of stock LLVM's release branch.</p>
</li>

<p>Ideally the above instructions are pretty smooth, but here's some caveats to
keep in mind while going through them:</p>
<ul>
<li>LLVM bugs are hard to find, don't hesitate to ask for help! Bisection is
definitely your friend here (yes LLVM takes forever to build, yet bisection is
still your friend)</li>
<li>If you've got general questions, <a href="https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/187780-t-compiler.2Fwg-llvm">wg-llvm</a> can help you out.</li>
<li>Creating branches is a privileged operation on GitHub, so you'll need someone
with write access to create the branches for you most likely.</li>

<p>NOTE: If you are looking for info about code generation, please see <a href="backend/./codegen.html">this
chapter</a> instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This section is about debugging compiler bugs in code generation (e.g. why the
compiler generated some piece of code or crashed in LLVM).  LLVM is a big
project on its own that probably needs to have its own debugging document (not
that I could find one). But here are some tips that are important in a rustc
context:</p>
<h3 id="minimize-the-example"><a class="header" href="#minimize-the-example">Minimize the example</a></h3>
<p>As a general rule, compilers generate lots of information from analyzing code.
Thus, a useful first step is usually to find a minimal example. One way to do
this is to</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>create a new crate that reproduces the issue (e.g. adding whatever crate is
at fault as a dependency, and using it from there)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>minimize the crate by removing external dependencies; that is, moving
everything relevant to the new crate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>further minimize the issue by making the code shorter (there are tools that
help with this like <code>creduce</code>)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For more discussion on methodology for steps 2 and 3 above, there is an
<a href="https://blog.pnkfx.org/blog/2019/11/18/rust-bug-minimization-patterns/">epic blog post</a> from pnkfelix specifically about Rust program minimization.</p>
<h3 id="enable-llvm-internal-checks"><a class="header" href="#enable-llvm-internal-checks">Enable LLVM internal checks</a></h3>
<p>The official compilers (including nightlies) have LLVM assertions disabled,
which means that LLVM assertion failures can show up as compiler crashes (not
ICEs but &quot;real&quot; crashes) and other sorts of weird behavior. If you are
encountering these, it is a good idea to try using a compiler with LLVM
assertions enabled - either an &quot;alt&quot; nightly or a compiler you build yourself
by setting <code>[llvm] assertions=true</code> in your config.toml - and see whether
anything turns up.</p>
<p>The rustc build process builds the LLVM tools into
<code>./build/&lt;host-triple&gt;/llvm/bin</code>. They can be called directly.
These tools include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/llc.html"><code>llc</code></a>, which compiles bitcode (<code>.bc</code> files) to executable code; this can be used to
replicate LLVM backend bugs.</li>
<li><a href="https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/opt.html"><code>opt</code></a>, a bitcode transformer that runs LLVM optimization passes.</li>
<li><a href="https://llvm.org/docs/Bugpoint.html"><code>bugpoint</code></a>, which reduces large test cases to small, useful ones.</li>
<li>and many others, some of which are referenced in the text below.</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, the Rust build system does not check for changes to the LLVM source code or
its build configuration settings. So, if you need to rebuild the LLVM that is linked
into <code>rustc</code>, first delete the file <code>llvm-finished-building</code>, which should be located
in <code>build/&lt;host-triple&gt;/llvm/</code>.</p>
<p>The default rustc compilation pipeline has multiple codegen units, which is
hard to replicate manually and means that LLVM is called multiple times in
parallel.  If you can get away with it (i.e. if it doesn't make your bug
disappear), passing <code>-C codegen-units=1</code> to rustc will make debugging easier.</p>
<h3 id="get-your-hands-on-raw-llvm-input"><a class="header" href="#get-your-hands-on-raw-llvm-input">Get your hands on raw LLVM input</a></h3>
<p>For rustc to generate LLVM IR, you need to pass the <code>--emit=llvm-ir</code> flag. If
you are building via cargo, use the <code>RUSTFLAGS</code> environment variable (e.g.
<code>RUSTFLAGS='--emit=llvm-ir'</code>). This causes rustc to spit out LLVM IR into the
target directory.</p>
<p><code>cargo llvm-ir [options] path</code> spits out the LLVM IR for a particular function
at <code>path</code>. (<code>cargo install cargo-asm</code> installs <code>cargo asm</code> and <code>cargo llvm-ir</code>). <code>--build-type=debug</code> emits code for debug builds. There are also
other useful options. Also, debug info in LLVM IR can clutter the output a lot:
<code>RUSTFLAGS=&quot;-C debuginfo=0&quot;</code> is really useful.</p>
<p><code>RUSTFLAGS=&quot;-C save-temps&quot;</code> outputs LLVM bitcode (not the same as IR) at
different stages during compilation, which is sometimes useful. The output LLVM
bitcode will be in <code>.bc</code> files in the compiler's output directory, set via the
<code>--out-dir DIR</code> argument to <code>rustc</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you are hitting an assertion failure or segmentation fault from the LLVM
backend when invoking <code>rustc</code> itself, it is a good idea to try passing each
of these <code>.bc</code> files to the <code>llc</code> command, and see if you get the same
failure. (LLVM developers often prefer a bug reduced to a <code>.bc</code> file over one
that uses a Rust crate for its minimized reproduction.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To get human readable versions of the LLVM bitcode, one just needs to convert
the bitcode (<code>.bc</code>) files to <code>.ll</code> files using <code>llvm-dis</code>, which should be in
the target local compilation of rustc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that rustc emits different IR depending on whether <code>-O</code> is enabled, even
without LLVM's optimizations, so if you want to play with the IR rustc emits,
you should:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ rustc +local my-file.rs --emit=llvm-ir -O -C no-prepopulate-passes \
    -C codegen-units=1
$ OPT=./build/$TRIPLE/llvm/bin/opt
$ $OPT -S -O2 &lt; my-file.ll &gt; my
</code></pre>
<p>If you just want to get the LLVM IR during the LLVM pipeline, to e.g. see which
IR causes an optimization-time assertion to fail, or to see when LLVM performs
a particular optimization, you can pass the rustc flag <code>-C llvm-args=-print-after-all</code>, and possibly add <code>-C llvm-args='-filter-print-funcs=EXACT_FUNCTION_NAME</code> (e.g.  <code>-C llvm-args='-filter-print-funcs=_ZN11collections3str21_$LT$impl$u20$str$GT$\ 7replace17hbe10ea2e7c809b0bE'</code>).</p>
<p>That produces a lot of output into standard error, so you'll want to pipe that
to some file. Also, if you are using neither <code>-filter-print-funcs</code> nor <code>-C codegen-units=1</code>, then, because the multiple codegen units run in parallel, the
printouts will mix together and you won't be able to read anything.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>One caveat to the aforementioned methodology: the <code>-print</code> family of options
to LLVM only prints the IR unit that the pass runs on (e.g., just a
function), and does not include any referenced declarations, globals,
metadata, etc. This means you cannot in general feed the output of <code>-print</code>
into <code>llc</code> to reproduce a given problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Within LLVM itself, calling <code>F.getParent()-&gt;dump()</code> at the beginning of
<code>SafeStackLegacyPass::runOnFunction</code> will dump the whole module, which
may provide better basis for reproduction. (However, you
should be able to get that same dump from the <code>.bc</code> files dumped by
<code>-C save-temps</code>.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want just the IR for a specific function (say, you want to see why it
causes an assertion or doesn't optimize correctly), you can use <code>llvm-extract</code>,
e.g.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ ./build/$TRIPLE/llvm/bin/llvm-extract \
    -func='_ZN11collections3str21_$LT$impl$u20$str$GT$7replace17hbe10ea2e7c809b0bE' \
    -S \
    &lt; unextracted.ll \
    &gt; extracted.ll
</code></pre>
<h3 id="investigate-llvm-optimization-passes"><a class="header" href="#investigate-llvm-optimization-passes">Investigate LLVM optimization passes</a></h3>
<p>If you are seeing incorrect behavior due to an optimization pass, a very handy
LLVM option is <code>-opt-bisect-limit</code>, which takes an integer denoting the index
value of the highest pass to run.  Index values for taken passes are stable
from run to run; by coupling this with software that automates bisecting the
search space based on the resulting program, an errant pass can be quickly
determined.  When an <code>-opt-bisect-limit</code> is specified, all runs are displayed
to standard error, along with their index and output indicating if the
pass was run or skipped.  Setting the limit to an index of -1 (e.g.,
<code>RUSTFLAGS=&quot;-C llvm-args=-opt-bisect-limit=-1&quot;</code>) will show all passes and
their corresponding index values.</p>
<p>If you want to play with the optimization pipeline, you can use the <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/opt.html"><code>opt</code></a> tool
from <code>./build/&lt;host-triple&gt;/llvm/bin/</code> with the LLVM IR emitted by rustc.</p>
<p>When investigating the implementation of LLVM itself, you should be
aware of its <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/ProgrammersManual.html#the-llvm-debug-macro-and-debug-option">internal debug infrastructure</a>.
This is provided in LLVM Debug builds, which you enable for rustc
LLVM builds by changing this setting in the config.toml:</p>
<pre><code>[llvm]
# Indicates whether the LLVM assertions are enabled or not
assertions = true

# Indicates whether the LLVM build is a Release or Debug build
optimize = false
</code></pre>
<p>The quick summary is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting <code>assertions=true</code> enables coarse-grain debug messaging.
<ul>
<li>beyond that, setting <code>optimize=false</code> enables fine-grain debug messaging.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>LLVM_DEBUG(dbgs() &lt;&lt; msg)</code> in LLVM is like <code>debug!(msg)</code> in <code>rustc</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>-debug</code> option turns on all messaging; it is like setting the
environment variable <code>RUSTC_LOG=debug</code> in <code>rustc</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>-debug-only=&lt;pass1&gt;,&lt;pass2&gt;</code> variant is more selective; it is like
setting the environment variable <code>RUSTC_LOG=path1,path2</code> in <code>rustc</code>.</li>

<p>The <code>-C help</code> and <code>-Z help</code> compiler switches will list out a variety
of interesting options you may find useful. Here are a few of the most
common that pertain to LLVM development (some of them are employed in the
tutorial above):</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>--emit llvm-ir</code> option emits a <code>&lt;filename&gt;.ll</code> file with LLVM IR in textual format
<ul>
<li>The <code>--emit llvm-bc</code> option emits in bytecode format (<code>&lt;filename&gt;.bc</code>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Passing <code>-C llvm-args=&lt;foo&gt;</code> allows passing pretty much all the
options that tools like llc and opt would accept;
e.g. <code>-C llvm-args=-print-before-all</code> to print IR before every LLVM
pass.</li>
<li>The <code>-C no-prepopulate-passes</code> will avoid pre-populate the LLVM pass
manager with a list of passes.  This will allow you to view the LLVM
IR that rustc generates, not the LLVM IR after optimizations.</li>
<li>The <code>-C passes=val</code> option allows you to supply a space separated list of extra LLVM passes to run</li>
<li>The <code>-C save-temps</code> option saves all temporary output files during compilation</li>
<li>The <code>-Z print-llvm-passes</code> option will print out LLVM optimization passes being run</li>
<li>The <code>-Z time-llvm-passes</code> option measures the time of each LLVM pass</li>
<li>The <code>-Z verify-llvm-ir</code> option will verify the LLVM IR for correctness</li>
<li>The <code>-Z no-parallel-llvm</code> will disable parallel compilation of distinct compilation units</li>
<li>The <code>-Z llvm-time-trace</code> option will output a Chrome profiler compatible JSON file
which contains details and timings for LLVM passes.</li>
<li>The <code>-C llvm-args=-opt-bisect-limit=&lt;index&gt;</code> option allows for bisecting LLVM
optimizations.</li>

really helpful for this.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Once you have some LLVM IR for the problematic code (see above), you can
create a minimal working example with Godbolt. Go to
<a href="https://llvm.godbolt.org">llvm.godbolt.org</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose <code>LLVM-IR</code> as programming language.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use <code>llc</code> to compile the IR to a particular target as is:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are some useful flags: <code>-mattr</code> enables target features, <code>-march=</code>
selects the target, <code>-mcpu=</code> selects the CPU, etc.</li>
<li>Commands like <code>llc -march=help</code> output all architectures available, which
is useful because sometimes the Rust arch names and the LLVM names do not
match.</li>
<li>If you have compiled rustc yourself somewhere, in the target directory
you have binaries for <code>llc</code>, <code>opt</code>, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to optimize the LLVM-IR, you can use <code>opt</code> to see how the LLVM
optimizations transform it.</p>

<h2 id="state-of-the-code-before-the-refactoring"><a class="header" href="#state-of-the-code-before-the-refactoring">State of the code before the refactoring</a></h2>
<p>All the code related to the compilation of MIR into LLVM IR was contained
inside the <code>rustc_codegen_llvm</code> crate. Here is the breakdown of the most
important elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <code>back</code> folder (7,800 LOC) implements the mechanisms for creating the
different object files and archive through LLVM, but also the communication
mechanisms for parallel code generation;</li>
<li>the <code>debuginfo</code> (3,200 LOC) folder contains all code that passes debug
information down to LLVM;</li>
<li>the <code>llvm</code> (2,200 LOC) folder defines the FFI necessary to communicate with
LLVM using the C++ API;</li>
<li>the <code>mir</code> (4,300 LOC) folder implements the actual lowering from MIR to LLVM
IR;</li>
<li>the <code>base.rs</code> (1,300 LOC) file contains some helper functions but also the
high-level code that launches the code generation and distributes the work.</li>
<li>the <code>builder.rs</code> (1,200 LOC) file contains all the functions generating
individual LLVM IR instructions inside a basic block;</li>
<li>the <code>common.rs</code> (450 LOC) contains various helper functions and all the
functions generating LLVM static values;</li>
<li>the <code>type_.rs</code> (300 LOC) defines most of the type translations to LLVM IR.</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of this refactoring is to separate inside this crate code that is
specific to the LLVM from code that can be reused for other rustc backends. For
instance, the <code>mir</code> folder is almost entirely backend-specific but it relies
heavily on other parts of the crate. The separation of the code must not affect
the logic of the code nor its performance.</p>
<p>For these reasons, the separation process involves two transformations that
have to be done at the same time for the resulting code to compile :</p>
<ol>
<li>replace all the LLVM-specific types by generics inside function signatures
and structure definitions;</li>
<li>encapsulate all functions calling the LLVM FFI inside a set of traits that
will define the interface between backend-agnostic code and the backend.</li>
</ol>
<p>While the LLVM-specific code will be left in <code>rustc_codegen_llvm</code>, all the new
traits and backend-agnostic code will be moved in <code>rustc_codegen_ssa</code> (name
suggestion by @eddyb).</p>
<h2 id="generic-types-and-structures"><a class="header" href="#generic-types-and-structures">Generic types and structures</a></h2>
<p>@irinagpopa started to parametrize the types of <code>rustc_codegen_llvm</code> by a
generic <code>Value</code> type, implemented in LLVM by a reference <code>&amp;'ll Value</code>. This
work has been extended to all structures inside the <code>mir</code> folder and elsewhere,
as well as for LLVM's <code>BasicBlock</code> and <code>Type</code> types.</p>
<p>The two most important structures for the LLVM codegen are <code>CodegenCx</code> and
<code>Builder</code>. They are parametrized by multiple lifetime parameters and the type
for <code>Value</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">struct CodegenCx&lt;'ll, 'tcx&gt; {
  /* ... */
}

struct Builder&lt;'a, 'll, 'tcx&gt; {
  cx: &amp;'a CodegenCx&lt;'ll, 'tcx&gt;,
  /* ... */
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>CodegenCx</code> is used to compile one codegen-unit that can contain multiple
functions, whereas <code>Builder</code> is created to compile one basic block.</p>
<p>The code in <code>rustc_codegen_llvm</code> has to deal with multiple explicit lifetime
parameters, that correspond to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>'tcx</code> is the longest lifetime, that corresponds to the original <code>TyCtxt</code>
containing the program's information;</li>
<li><code>'a</code> is a short-lived reference of a <code>CodegenCx</code> or another object inside a
struct;</li>
<li><code>'ll</code> is the lifetime of references to LLVM objects such as <code>Value</code> or
<code>Type</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although there are already many lifetime parameters in the code, making it
generic uncovered situations where the borrow-checker was passing only due to
the special nature of the LLVM objects manipulated (they are extern pointers).
For instance, an additional lifetime parameter had to be added to
<code>LocalAnalyser</code> in <code>analyse.rs</code>, leading to the definition:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">struct LocalAnalyzer&lt;'mir, 'a, 'tcx&gt; {
  /* ... */
}
</code></pre>
<p>However, the two most important structures <code>CodegenCx</code> and <code>Builder</code> are not
defined in the backend-agnostic code. Indeed, their content is highly specific
of the backend and it makes more sense to leave their definition to the backend
implementor than to allow just a narrow spot via a generic field for the
backend's context.</p>
<h2 id="traits-and-interface"><a class="header" href="#traits-and-interface">Traits and interface</a></h2>
<p>Because they have to be defined by the backend, <code>CodegenCx</code> and <code>Builder</code> will
be the structures implementing all the traits defining the backend's interface.
These traits are defined in the folder <code>rustc_codegen_ssa/traits</code> and all the
backend-agnostic code is parametrized by them. For instance, let us explain how
a function in <code>base.rs</code> is parametrized:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub fn codegen_instance&lt;'a, 'tcx, Bx: BuilderMethods&lt;'a, 'tcx&gt;&gt;(
    cx: &amp;'a Bx::CodegenCx,
    instance: Instance&lt;'tcx&gt;
) {
    /* ... */
}
</code></pre>
<p>In this signature, we have the two lifetime parameters explained earlier and
the master type <code>Bx</code> which satisfies the trait <code>BuilderMethods</code> corresponding
to the interface satisfied by the <code>Builder</code> struct. The <code>BuilderMethods</code>
defines an associated type <code>Bx::CodegenCx</code> that itself satisfies the
<code>CodegenMethods</code> traits implemented by the struct <code>CodegenCx</code>.</p>
<p>On the trait side, here is an example with part of the definition of
<code>BuilderMethods</code> in <code>traits/builder.rs</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">pub trait BuilderMethods&lt;'a, 'tcx&gt;:
    HasCodegen&lt;'tcx&gt;
    + DebugInfoBuilderMethods&lt;'tcx&gt;
    + ArgTypeMethods&lt;'tcx&gt;
    + AbiBuilderMethods&lt;'tcx&gt;
    + IntrinsicCallMethods&lt;'tcx&gt;
    + AsmBuilderMethods&lt;'tcx&gt;
{
    fn new_block&lt;'b&gt;(
        cx: &amp;'a Self::CodegenCx,
        llfn: Self::Function,
        name: &amp;'b str
    ) -&gt; Self;
    /* ... */
    fn cond_br(
        &amp;mut self,
        cond: Self::Value,
        then_llbb: Self::BasicBlock,
        else_llbb: Self::BasicBlock,
    );
    /* ... */
}
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, a master structure implementing the <code>ExtraBackendMethods</code> trait is
used for high-level codegen-driving functions like <code>codegen_crate</code> in
<code>base.rs</code>. For LLVM, it is the empty <code>LlvmCodegenBackend</code>.
<code>ExtraBackendMethods</code> should be implemented by the same structure that
implements the <code>CodegenBackend</code> defined in
<code>rustc_codegen_utils/codegen_backend.rs</code>.</p>
<p>During the traitification process, certain functions have been converted from
methods of a local structure to methods of <code>CodegenCx</code> or <code>Builder</code> and a
corresponding <code>self</code> parameter has been added. Indeed, LLVM stores information
internally that it can access when called through its API. This information
does not show up in a Rust data structure carried around when these methods are
called. However, when implementing a Rust backend for <code>rustc</code>, these methods
will need information from <code>CodegenCx</code>, hence the additional parameter (unused
in the LLVM implementation of the trait).</p>
<h2 id="state-of-the-code-after-the-refactoring"><a class="header" href="#state-of-the-code-after-the-refactoring">State of the code after the refactoring</a></h2>
<p>The traits offer an API which is very similar to the API of LLVM. This is not
the best solution since LLVM has a very special way of doing things: when
adding another backend, the traits definition might be changed in order to
offer more flexibility.</p>
<p>However, the current separation between backend-agnostic and LLVM-specific code
has allowed the reuse of a significant part of the old <code>rustc_codegen_llvm</code>.
Here is the new LOC breakdown between backend-agnostic (BA) and LLVM for the
most important elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>back</code> folder: 3,800 (BA) vs 4,100 (LLVM);</li>
<li><code>mir</code> folder: 4,400 (BA) vs 0 (LLVM);</li>
<li><code>base.rs</code>: 1,100 (BA) vs 250 (LLVM);</li>
<li><code>builder.rs</code>: 1,400 (BA) vs 0 (LLVM);</li>
<li><code>common.rs</code>: 350 (BA) vs 350 (LLVM);</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>debuginfo</code> folder has been left almost untouched by the splitting and is
specific to LLVM. Only its high-level features have been traitified.</p>
<p>The new <code>traits</code> folder has 1500 LOC only for trait definitions. Overall, the
27,000 LOC-sized old <code>rustc_codegen_llvm</code> code has been split into the new
18,500 LOC-sized new <code>rustc_codegen_llvm</code> and the 12,000 LOC-sized
<code>rustc_codegen_ssa</code>. We can say that this refactoring allowed the reuse of
approximately 10,000 LOC that would otherwise have had to be duplicated between
the multiple backends of <code>rustc</code>.</p>
<p>The refactored version of <code>rustc</code>'s backend introduced no regression over the
test suite nor in performance benchmark, which is in coherence with the nature
of the refactoring that used only compile-time parametricity (no trait
objects).</p>

<p>Approved in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2091-inline-semantic.md">RFC 2091</a>, this feature enables the accurate reporting of caller location during panics
initiated from functions like <code>Option::unwrap</code>, <code>Result::expect</code>, and <code>Index::index</code>. This feature
adds the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/attributes/diagnostics.html#the-track_caller-attribute"><code>#[track_caller]</code></a> attribute for functions, the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/intrinsics/fn.caller_location.html"><code>caller_location</code></a> intrinsic, and the stabilization-friendly
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/panic/struct.Location.html#method.caller"><code>core::panic::Location::caller</code></a> wrapper.</p>
<h2 id="motivating-example"><a class="header" href="#motivating-example">Motivating Example</a></h2>
<p>Take this example program:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">fn main() {
    let foo: Option&lt;()&gt; = None;
    foo.unwrap(); // this should produce a useful panic message!
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Prior to Rust 1.42, panics like this <code>unwrap()</code> printed a location in core:</p>
<pre><code>$ rustc +1.41.0 example.rs; example.exe
thread 'main' panicked at 'called `Option::unwrap()` on a `None` value',...core\macros\mod.rs:15:40
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace.
</code></pre>
<p>As of 1.42, we get a much more helpful message:</p>
<pre><code>$ rustc +1.42.0 example.rs; example.exe
thread 'main' panicked at 'called `Option::unwrap()` on a `None` value', example.rs:3:5
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
</code></pre>
<p>These error messages are achieved through a combination of changes to <code>panic!</code> internals to make use
of <code>core::panic::Location::caller</code> and a number of <code>#[track_caller]</code> annotations in the standard
library which propagate caller information.</p>
<h2 id="reading-caller-location"><a class="header" href="#reading-caller-location">Reading Caller Location</a></h2>
<p>Previously, <code>panic!</code> made use of the <code>file!()</code>, <code>line!()</code>, and <code>column!()</code> macros to construct a
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/core/panic/struct.Location.html"><code>Location</code></a> pointing to where the panic occurred. These macros couldn't be given an overridden
location, so functions which intentionally invoked <code>panic!</code> couldn't provide their own location,
hiding the actual source of error.</p>
<p>Internally, <code>panic!()</code> now calls <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/panic/struct.Location.html#method.caller"><code>core::panic::Location::caller()</code></a> to find out where it
was expanded. This function is itself annotated with <code>#[track_caller]</code> and wraps the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/intrinsics/fn.caller_location.html"><code>caller_location</code></a> compiler intrinsic implemented by rustc. This intrinsic is easiest
explained in terms of how it works in a <code>const</code> context.</p>
<h2 id="caller-location-in-const"><a class="header" href="#caller-location-in-const">Caller Location in <code>const</code></a></h2>
<p>There are two main phases to returning the caller location in a const context: walking up the stack
to find the right location and allocating a const value to return.</p>
<h3 id="finding-the-right-location"><a class="header" href="#finding-the-right-location">Finding the right <code>Location</code></a></h3>
<p>In a const context we &quot;walk up the stack&quot; from where the intrinsic is invoked, stopping when we
reach the first function call in the stack which does <em>not</em> have the attribute. This walk is in
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_const_eval/interpret/struct.InterpCx.html#method.find_closest_untracked_caller_location"><code>InterpCx::find_closest_untracked_caller_location()</code></a>.</p>
<p>Starting at the bottom, we iterate up over stack <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_const_eval/interpret/struct.Frame.html"><code>Frame</code></a>s in the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_const_eval/interpret/struct.InterpCx.html#structfield.stack"><code>InterpCx::stack</code></a>, calling
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/enum.InstanceDef.html#method.requires_caller_location"><code>InstanceDef::requires_caller_location</code></a> on the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_const_eval/interpret/struct.Frame.html#structfield.instance"><code>Instance</code>s from each <code>Frame</code></a>. We stop once we find one that returns <code>false</code> and
return the span of the <em>previous</em> frame which was the &quot;topmost&quot; tracked function.</p>
<h3 id="allocating-a-static-location"><a class="header" href="#allocating-a-static-location">Allocating a static <code>Location</code></a></h3>
<p>Once we have a <code>Span</code>, we need to allocate static memory for the <code>Location</code>, which is performed by
the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/struct.TyCtxt.html#method.const_caller_location"><code>TyCtxt::const_caller_location()</code></a> query. Internally this calls
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_const_eval/interpret/struct.InterpCx.html#method.alloc_caller_location"><code>InterpCx::alloc_caller_location()</code></a> and results in a unique
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_const_eval/interpret/enum.MemoryKind.html#variant.CallerLocation">memory kind</a> (<code>MemoryKind::CallerLocation</code>). The SSA codegen backend is able
to emit code for these same values, and we use this code there as well.</p>
<p>Once our <code>Location</code> has been allocated in static memory, our intrinsic returns a reference to it.</p>
<h2 id="generating-code-for-track_caller-callees"><a class="header" href="#generating-code-for-track_caller-callees">Generating code for <code>#[track_caller]</code> callees</a></h2>
<p>To generate efficient code for a tracked function and its callers, we need to provide the same
behavior from the intrinsic's point of view without having a stack to walk up at runtime. We invert
the approach: as we grow the stack down we pass an additional argument to calls of tracked functions
rather than walking up the stack when the intrinsic is called. That additional argument can be
returned wherever the caller location is queried.</p>
<p>The argument we append is of type <code>&amp;'static core::panic::Location&lt;'static&gt;</code>. A reference was chosen
to avoid unnecessary copying because a pointer is a third the size of
<code>std::mem::size_of::&lt;core::panic::Location&gt;() == 24</code> at time of writing.</p>
<p>When generating a call to a function which is tracked, we pass the location argument the value of
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_codegen_ssa/mir/struct.FunctionCx.html#method.get_caller_location"><code>FunctionCx::get_caller_location</code></a>.</p>
<p>If the calling function is tracked, <code>get_caller_location</code> returns the local in
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_codegen_ssa/mir/struct.FunctionCx.html#structfield.caller_location"><code>FunctionCx::caller_location</code></a> which was populated by the current caller's caller.
In these cases the intrinsic &quot;returns&quot; a reference which was actually provided in an argument to its
caller.</p>
<p>If the calling function is not tracked, <code>get_caller_location</code> allocates a <code>Location</code> static from
the current <code>Span</code> and returns a reference to that.</p>
<p>We more efficiently achieve the same behavior as a loop starting from the bottom by passing a single
<code>&amp;Location</code> value through the <code>caller_location</code> fields of multiple <code>FunctionCx</code>s as we grow the
stack downward.</p>
<h3 id="codegen-examples"><a class="header" href="#codegen-examples">Codegen examples</a></h3>
<p>What does this transformation look like in practice? Take this example which uses the new feature:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">#![feature(track_caller)]
use std::panic::Location;

#[track_caller]
fn print_caller() {
    println!(&quot;called from {}&quot;, Location::caller());
}

fn main() {
    print_caller();
}
</code></pre></pre>
<p>Here <code>print_caller()</code> appears to take no arguments, but we compile it to something like this:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust">#![feature(panic_internals)]
use std::panic::Location;

fn print_caller(caller: &amp;Location) {
    println!(&quot;called from {}&quot;, caller);
}

fn main() {
    print_caller(&amp;Location::internal_constructor(file!(), line!(), column!()));
}
</code></pre></pre>
<h3 id="dynamic-dispatch"><a class="header" href="#dynamic-dispatch">Dynamic Dispatch</a></h3>
<p>In codegen contexts we have to modify the callee ABI to pass this information down the stack, but
the attribute expressly does <em>not</em> modify the type of the function. The ABI change must be
transparent to type checking and remain sound in all uses.</p>
<p>Direct calls to tracked functions will always know the full codegen flags for the callee and can
generate appropriate code. Indirect callers won't have this information and it's not encoded in
the type of the function pointer they call, so we generate a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/enum.InstanceDef.html#variant.ReifyShim"><code>ReifyShim</code></a> around the function
whenever taking a pointer to it. This shim isn't able to report the actual location of the indirect
call (the function's definition site is reported instead), but it prevents miscompilation and is
probably the best we can do without modifying fully-stabilized type signatures.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Note:</em> We always emit a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/enum.InstanceDef.html#variant.ReifyShim"><code>ReifyShim</code></a> when taking a pointer to a tracked function. While the
constraint here is imposed by codegen contexts, we don't know during MIR construction of the shim
whether we'll be called in a const context (safe to ignore shim) or in a codegen context (unsafe
to ignore shim). Even if we did know, the results from const and codegen contexts must agree.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-attribute"><a class="header" href="#the-attribute">The Attribute</a></h2>
<p>The <code>#[track_caller]</code> attribute is checked alongside other codegen attributes to ensure the
function:</p>
<ul>
<li>has the <code>&quot;Rust&quot;</code> ABI (as opposed to e.g., <code>&quot;C&quot;</code>)</li>
<li>is not a closure</li>
<li>is not <code>#[naked]</code></li>
</ul>
<p>If the use is valid, we set <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/middle/codegen_fn_attrs/struct.CodegenFnAttrFlags.html#associatedconstant.TRACK_CALLER"><code>CodegenFnAttrsFlags::TRACK_CALLER</code></a>. This flag influences
the return value of <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/enum.InstanceDef.html#method.requires_caller_location"><code>InstanceDef::requires_caller_location</code></a> which is in turn
used in both const and codegen contexts to ensure correct propagation.</p>
<h3 id="traits"><a class="header" href="#traits">Traits</a></h3>
<p>When applied to trait method implementations, the attribute works as it does for regular functions.</p>
<p>When applied to a trait method prototype, the attribute applies to all implementations of the
method. When applied to a default trait method implementation, the attribute takes effect on
that implementation <em>and</em> any overrides.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, this feature's goal is to improve common Rust error messages without breaking
stability guarantees, requiring modifications to end-user source, relying on platform-specific
debug-info, or preventing user-defined types from having the same error-reporting benefits.</p>
<p>Improving the output of these panics has been a goal of proposals since at least mid-2016 (see
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2091-inline-semantic.md#non-viable-alternatives">non-viable alternatives</a> in the approved RFC for details). It took two more years until RFC 2091
was approved, much of its <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2091-inline-semantic.md#rationale">rationale</a> for this feature's design having been discovered through the
discussion around several earlier proposals.</p>
<p>The design in the original RFC limited itself to implementations that could be done inside the
compiler at the time without significant refactoring. However in the year and a half between the
approval of the RFC and the actual implementation work, a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/47809#issuecomment-443538059">revised design</a> was proposed and written
up on the tracking issue. During the course of implementing that, it was also discovered that an
implementation was possible without modifying the number of arguments in a function's MIR, which
would simplify later stages and unlock use in traits.</p>
<p>Because the RFC's implementation strategy could not readily support traits, the semantics were not
originally specified. They have since been implemented following the path which seemed most correct
to the author and reviewers.</p>

<p>When the compiler sees a reference to an external crate, it needs to load some
information about that crate. This chapter gives an overview of that process,
and the supported file formats for crate libraries.</p>
<h2 id="libraries"><a class="header" href="#libraries">Libraries</a></h2>
<p>A crate dependency can be loaded from an <code>rlib</code>, <code>dylib</code>, or <code>rmeta</code> file. A
key point of these file formats is that they contain <code>rustc</code>-specific
<a href="backend/libs-and-metadata.html#metadata"><em>metadata</em></a>. This metadata allows the compiler to discover enough
information about the external crate to understand the items it contains,
which macros it exports, and <em>much</em> more.</p>
<h3 id="rlib"><a class="header" href="#rlib">rlib</a></h3>
<p>An <code>rlib</code> is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ar_(Unix)">archive file</a>, which is similar to a tar file. This file
format is specific to <code>rustc</code>, and may change over time. This file contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>Object code, which is the result of code generation. This is used during
regular linking. There is a separate <code>.o</code> file for each <a href="backend/../backend/codegen.html">codegen unit</a>. The
codegen step can be skipped with the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/codegen-options/index.html#linker-plugin-lto"><code>-C linker-plugin-lto</code></a> CLI option, which means each <code>.o</code>
file will only contain LLVM bitcode.</li>
<li><a href="https://llvm.org/docs/BitCodeFormat.html">LLVM bitcode</a>, which is a binary representation of LLVM's intermediate
representation, which is embedded as a section in the <code>.o</code> files. This can
be used for <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/LinkTimeOptimization.html">Link Time Optimization</a> (LTO). This can be removed with the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/codegen-options/index.html#embed-bitcode"><code>-C embed-bitcode=no</code></a> CLI option to improve compile times
and reduce disk space if LTO is not needed.</li>
<li><code>rustc</code> <a href="backend/libs-and-metadata.html#metadata">metadata</a>, in a file named <code>lib.rmeta</code>.</li>
<li>A symbol table, which is generally a list of symbols with offsets to the
object file that contain that symbol. This is pretty standard for archive
files.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="dylib"><a class="header" href="#dylib">dylib</a></h3>
<p>A <code>dylib</code> is a platform-specific shared library. It includes the <code>rustc</code>
<a href="backend/libs-and-metadata.html#metadata">metadata</a> in a special link section called <code>.rustc</code> in a compressed format.</p>
<h3 id="rmeta"><a class="header" href="#rmeta">rmeta</a></h3>
<p>An <code>rmeta</code> file is custom binary format that contains the <a href="backend/libs-and-metadata.html#metadata">metadata</a> for the
crate. This file can be used for fast &quot;checks&quot; of a project by skipping all
code generation (as is done with <code>cargo check</code>), collecting enough information
for documentation (as is done with <code>cargo doc</code>), or for
<a href="backend/libs-and-metadata.html#pipelining">pipelining</a>. This file is created if the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/command-line-arguments.html#option-emit"><code>--emit=metadata</code></a> CLI option is used.</p>
<p><code>rmeta</code> files do not support linking, since they do not contain compiled
object files.</p>
<h2 id="metadata"><a class="header" href="#metadata">Metadata</a></h2>
<p>The metadata contains a wide swath of different elements. This guide will not
go into detail of every field it contains. You are encouraged to browse the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_metadata/rmeta/struct.CrateRoot.html"><code>CrateRoot</code></a> definition to get a sense of the different elements it contains.
Everything about metadata encoding and decoding is in the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_metadata/index.html"><code>rustc_metadata</code></a>
package.</p>
<p>Here are a few highlights of things it contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>The version of the <code>rustc</code> compiler. The compiler will refuse to load files
from any other version.</li>
<li>The <a href="backend/libs-and-metadata.html#strict-version-hash">Strict Version Hash</a> (SVH). This helps ensure the
correct dependency is loaded.</li>
<li>The <a href="backend/libs-and-metadata.html#stable-crate-id">Stable Crate Id</a>. This is a hash used
to identify crates.</li>
<li>Information about all the source files in the library. This can be used for
a variety of things, such as diagnostics pointing to sources in a
dependency.</li>
<li>Information about exported macros, traits, types, and items. Generally,
anything that's needed to be known when a path references something inside a
crate dependency.</li>
<li>Encoded <a href="backend/../mir/index.html">MIR</a>. This is optional, and only encoded if needed for code
generation. <code>cargo check</code> skips this for performance reasons.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="strict-version-hash"><a class="header" href="#strict-version-hash">Strict Version Hash</a></h3>
<p>The Strict Version Hash (<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_data_structures/svh/struct.Svh.html">SVH</a>, also known as the &quot;crate hash&quot;) is a 64-bit
hash that is used to ensure that the correct crate dependencies are loaded. It
is possible for a directory to contain multiple copies of the same dependency
built with different settings, or built from different sources. The crate
loader will skip any crates that have the wrong SVH.</p>
<p>The SVH is also used for the <a href="backend/../queries/incremental-compilation.html">incremental compilation</a> session filename,
though that usage is mostly historic.</p>
<p>The hash includes a variety of elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hashes of the HIR nodes.</li>
<li>All of the upstream crate hashes.</li>
<li>All of the source filenames.</li>
<li>Hashes of certain command-line flags (like <code>-C metadata</code> via the <a href="backend/libs-and-metadata.html#crate-disambiguator">Crate
Disambiguator</a>, and all CLI options marked with
<code>[TRACKED]</code>).</li>
</ul>
<p>See <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_ast_lowering/struct.LoweringContext.html#method.compute_hir_hash"><code>compute_hir_hash</code></a> for where the hash is actually computed.</p>
<h3 id="stable-crate-id"><a class="header" href="#stable-crate-id">Stable Crate Id</a></h3>
<p>The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_span/def_id/struct.StableCrateId.html"><code>StableCrateId</code></a> is a 64-bit hash used to identify different crates with
potentially the same name. It is a hash of the crate name and all the
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/codegen-options/index.html#metadata"><code>-C metadata</code></a> CLI options computed in <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_span/def_id/struct.StableCrateId.html#method.new"><code>StableCrateId::new</code></a>. It is
used in a variety of places, such as symbol name mangling, crate loading, and
much more.</p>
<p>By default, all Rust symbols are mangled and incorporate the stable crate id.
This allows multiple versions of the same crate to be included together. Cargo
automatically generates <code>-C metadata</code> hashes based on a variety of factors,
like the package version, source, and the target kind (a lib and test can have
the same crate name, so they need to be disambiguated).</p>
<h2 id="crate-loading"><a class="header" href="#crate-loading">Crate loading</a></h2>
<p>Crate loading can have quite a few subtle complexities. During <a href="backend/../name-resolution.html">name
resolution</a>, when an external crate is referenced (via an <code>extern crate</code> or
path), the resolver uses the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_metadata/creader/struct.CrateLoader.html"><code>CrateLoader</code></a> which is responsible for finding
the crate libraries and loading the <a href="backend/libs-and-metadata.html#metadata">metadata</a> for them. After the dependency
is loaded, the <code>CrateLoader</code> will provide the information the resolver needs
to perform its job (such as expanding macros, resolving paths, etc.).</p>
<p>To load each external crate, the <code>CrateLoader</code> uses a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_metadata/locator/struct.CrateLocator.html"><code>CrateLocator</code></a> to
actually find the correct files for one specific crate. There is some great
documentation in the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_metadata/locator/index.html"><code>locator</code></a> module that goes into detail on how loading
works, and I strongly suggest reading it to get the full picture.</p>
<p>The location of a dependency can come from several different places. Direct
dependencies are usually passed with <code>--extern</code> flags, and the loader can look
at those directly. Direct dependencies often have references to their own
dependencies, which need to be loaded, too. These are usually found by
scanning the directories passed with the <code>-L</code> flag for any file whose metadata
contains a matching crate name and <a href="backend/libs-and-metadata.html#strict-version-hash">SVH</a>. The loader
will also look at the <a href="backend/../building/bootstrapping.html#what-is-a-sysroot">sysroot</a> to find dependencies.</p>
<p>As crates are loaded, they are kept in the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_metadata/creader/struct.CStore.html"><code>CStore</code></a> with the crate metadata
wrapped in the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_metadata/rmeta/decoder/struct.CrateMetadata.html"><code>CrateMetadata</code></a> struct. After resolution and expansion, the
<code>CStore</code> will make its way into the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/ty/struct.GlobalCtxt.html"><code>GlobalCtxt</code></a> for the rest of
compilation.</p>
<h2 id="pipelining"><a class="header" href="#pipelining">Pipelining</a></h2>
<p>One trick to improve compile times is to start building a crate as soon as the
metadata for its dependencies is available. For a library, there is no need to
wait for the code generation of dependencies to finish. Cargo implements this
technique by telling <code>rustc</code> to emit an <a href="backend/libs-and-metadata.html#rmeta"><code>rmeta</code></a> file for each
dependency as well as an <a href="backend/libs-and-metadata.html#rlib"><code>rlib</code></a>. As early as it can, <code>rustc</code> will
save the <code>rmeta</code> file to disk before it continues to the code generation
phase. The compiler sends a JSON message to let the build tool know that it
can start building the next crate if possible.</p>
<p>The <a href="backend/libs-and-metadata.html#crate-loading">crate loading</a> system is smart enough to know when it
sees an <code>rmeta</code> file to use that if the <code>rlib</code> is not there (or has only been
partially written).</p>
<p>This pipelining isn't possible for binaries, because the linking phase will
require the code generation of all its dependencies. In the future, it may be
possible to further improve this scenario by splitting linking into a separate
command (see <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/64191">#64191</a>).</p>

<p><code>rustc</code> supports doing profile-guided optimization (PGO).
This chapter describes what PGO is and how the support for it is
implemented in <code>rustc</code>.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-profiled-guided-optimization"><a class="header" href="#what-is-profiled-guided-optimization">What Is Profiled-Guided Optimization?</a></h2>
<p>The basic concept of PGO is to collect data about the typical execution of
a program (e.g. which branches it is likely to take) and then use this data
to inform optimizations such as inlining, machine-code layout,
register allocation, etc.</p>
<p>There are different ways of collecting data about a program's execution.
One is to run the program inside a profiler (such as <code>perf</code>) and another
is to create an instrumented binary, that is, a binary that has data
collection built into it, and run that.
The latter usually provides more accurate data.</p>
<h2 id="how-is-pgo-implemented-in-rustc"><a class="header" href="#how-is-pgo-implemented-in-rustc">How is PGO implemented in <code>rustc</code>?</a></h2>
<p><code>rustc</code> current PGO implementation relies entirely on LLVM.
LLVM actually <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UsersManual.html#profile-guided-optimization">supports multiple forms</a> of PGO:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sampling-based PGO where an external profiling tool like <code>perf</code> is used
to collect data about a program's execution.</li>
<li>GCOV-based profiling, where code coverage infrastructure is used to collect
profiling information.</li>
<li>Front-end based instrumentation, where the compiler front-end (e.g. Clang)
inserts instrumentation intrinsics into the LLVM IR it generates (but see the
<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#note-instrument-coverage">1</a></sup>&quot;Note&quot;).</li>
<li>IR-level instrumentation, where LLVM inserts the instrumentation intrinsics
itself during optimization passes.</li>
</ul>
<p><code>rustc</code> supports only the last approach, IR-level instrumentation, mainly
because it is almost exclusively implemented in LLVM and needs little
maintenance on the Rust side. Fortunately, it is also the most modern approach,
yielding the best results.</p>
<p>So, we are dealing with an instrumentation-based approach, i.e. profiling data
is generated by a specially instrumented version of the program that's being
optimized. Instrumentation-based PGO has two components: a compile-time
component and run-time component, and one needs to understand the overall
workflow to see how they interact.</p>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="note-instrument-coverage"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">1</sup>
<p>Note: <code>rustc</code> now supports front-end-based coverage
instrumentation, via the experimental option
<a href="./llvm-coverage-instrumentation.html"><code>-C instrument-coverage</code></a>, but using these
coverage results for PGO has not been attempted at this time.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="overall-workflow"><a class="header" href="#overall-workflow">Overall Workflow</a></h3>
<p>Generating a PGO-optimized program involves the following four steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Compile the program with instrumentation enabled (e.g. <code>rustc -C profile-generate main.rs</code>)</li>
<li>Run the instrumented program (e.g. <code>./main</code>) which generates a <code>default-&lt;id&gt;.profraw</code> file</li>
<li>Convert the <code>.profraw</code> file into a <code>.profdata</code> file using LLVM's <code>llvm-profdata</code> tool.</li>
<li>Compile the program again, this time making use of the profiling data
(e.g. <code>rustc -C profile-use=merged.profdata main.rs</code>)</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="compile-time-aspects"><a class="header" href="#compile-time-aspects">Compile-Time Aspects</a></h3>
<p>Depending on which step in the above workflow we are in, two different things
can happen at compile time:</p>
<h4 id="create-binaries-with-instrumentation"><a class="header" href="#create-binaries-with-instrumentation">Create Binaries with Instrumentation</a></h4>
<p>As mentioned above, the profiling instrumentation is added by LLVM.
<code>rustc</code> instructs LLVM to do so <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/1.34.1/src/rustllvm/PassWrapper.cpp#L412-L416">by setting the appropriate</a>
flags when creating LLVM <code>PassManager</code>s:</p>
<pre><code class="language-C">	// `PMBR` is an `LLVMPassManagerBuilderRef`
    unwrap(PMBR)-&gt;EnablePGOInstrGen = true;
    // Instrumented binaries have a default output path for the `.profraw` file
    // hard-coded into them:
    unwrap(PMBR)-&gt;PGOInstrGen = PGOGenPath;
</code></pre>
<p><code>rustc</code> also has to make sure that some of the symbols from LLVM's profiling
runtime are not removed <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/1.34.1/src/librustc_codegen_ssa/back/symbol_export.rs#L212-L225">by marking the with the right export level</a>.</p>
<h4 id="compile-binaries-where-optimizations-make-use-of-profiling-data"><a class="header" href="#compile-binaries-where-optimizations-make-use-of-profiling-data">Compile Binaries Where Optimizations Make Use Of Profiling Data</a></h4>
<p>In the final step of the workflow described above, the program is compiled
again, with the compiler using the gathered profiling data in order to drive
optimization decisions. <code>rustc</code> again leaves most of the work to LLVM here,
basically <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/1.34.1/src/rustllvm/PassWrapper.cpp#L417-L420">just telling</a> the LLVM <code>PassManagerBuilder</code>
where the profiling data can be found:</p>
<pre><code class="language-C">	unwrap(PMBR)-&gt;PGOInstrUse = PGOUsePath;
</code></pre>
<p>LLVM does the rest (e.g. setting branch weights, marking functions with

<p>Instrumentation-based approaches always also have a runtime component, i.e.
once we have an instrumented program, that program needs to be run in order
to generate profiling data, and collecting and persisting this profiling
data needs some infrastructure in place.</p>
<p>In the case of LLVM, these runtime components are implemented in
<a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/compiler-rt/lib/profile">compiler-rt</a> and statically linked into any instrumented
binaries.
The <code>rustc</code> version of this can be found in <code>library/profiler_builtins</code> which
basically packs the C code from <code>compiler-rt</code> into a Rust crate.</p>
<p>In order for <code>profiler_builtins</code> to be built, <code>profiler = true</code> must be set
in <code>rustc</code>'s <code>config.toml</code>.</p>
<h2 id="testing-pgo"><a class="header" href="#testing-pgo">Testing PGO</a></h2>
<p>Since the PGO workflow spans multiple compiler invocations most testing happens
in <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/tests/run-make-fulldeps">run-make tests</a> (the relevant tests have <code>pgo</code> in their name).
There is also a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/tests/codegen/pgo-instrumentation.rs">codegen test</a> that checks that some expected
instrumentation artifacts show up in LLVM IR.</p>

<p><code>rustc</code> supports detailed source-based code and test coverage analysis
with a command line option (<code>-C instrument-coverage</code>) that instruments Rust
libraries and binaries with additional instructions and data, at compile time.</p>
<p>The coverage instrumentation injects calls to the LLVM intrinsic instruction
<a href="https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#llvm-instrprof-increment-intrinsic"><code>llvm.instrprof.increment</code></a> at code branches
(based on a MIR-based control flow analysis), and LLVM converts these to
instructions that increment static counters, when executed. The LLVM coverage
instrumentation also requires a <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/CoverageMappingFormat.html">Coverage Map</a> that encodes source metadata,
mapping counter IDs--directly and indirectly--to the file locations (with
start and end line and column).</p>
<p>Rust libraries, with or without coverage instrumentation, can be linked into
instrumented binaries. When the program is executed and cleanly terminates,
LLVM libraries write the final counter values to a file (<code>default.profraw</code> or
a custom file set through environment variable <code>LLVM_PROFILE_FILE</code>).</p>
<p>Developers use existing LLVM coverage analysis tools to decode <code>.profraw</code>
files, with corresponding Coverage Maps (from matching binaries that produced
them), and generate various reports for analysis, for example:</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of sample `llvm-cov show` result, for function add_quoted_string"
 src="img/llvm-cov-show-01.png" class="center"/>

<p>Detailed instructions and examples are documented in the

<h2 id="rust-symbol-mangling"><a class="header" href="#rust-symbol-mangling">Rust symbol mangling</a></h2>
<p><code>-C instrument-coverage</code> automatically enables Rust symbol mangling <code>v0</code> (as
if the user specified <code>-C symbol-mangling-version=v0</code> option when invoking
<code>rustc</code>) to ensure consistent and reversible name mangling. This has two
important benefits:</p>
<ol>
<li>LLVM coverage tools can analyze coverage over multiple runs, including some
changes to source code; so mangled names must be consistent across compilations.</li>
<li>LLVM coverage reports can report coverage by function, and even separates
out the coverage counts of each unique instantiation of a generic function,
if invoked with multiple type substitution variations.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="llvm-runtime-dependency"><a class="header" href="#llvm-runtime-dependency">LLVM Runtime Dependency</a></h3>
<p>Coverage data is only generated by running the executable Rust program. <code>rustc</code>
statically links coverage-instrumented binaries with LLVM runtime code
(<a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/compiler-rt/lib/profile">compiler-rt</a>) that implements program hooks
(such as an <code>exit</code> hook) to write the counter values to the <code>.profraw</code> file.</p>
<p>In the <code>rustc</code> source tree, <code>library/profiler_builtins</code> bundles the LLVM
<code>compiler-rt</code> code into a Rust library crate. (When building <code>rustc</code>, the
<code>profiler_builtins</code> library is only included when <code>profiler = true</code> is set
in <code>rustc</code>'s <code>config.toml</code>.)</p>
<p>When compiling with <code>-C instrument-coverage</code>,
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_metadata/creader/struct.CrateLoader.html#method.postprocess"><code>CrateLoader::postprocess()</code></a> dynamically loads the
<code>profiler_builtins</code> library by calling <code>inject_profiler_runtime()</code>.</p>
<h3 id="mir-pass-instrumentcoverage"><a class="header" href="#mir-pass-instrumentcoverage">MIR Pass: <code>InstrumentCoverage</code></a></h3>
<p>Coverage instrumentation is performed on the MIR with a <a href="mir/passes.html">MIR pass</a>
called <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/compiler/rustc_mir_transform/src/coverage"><code>InstrumentCoverage</code></a>. This MIR pass analyzes
the control flow graph (CFG)--represented by MIR <code>BasicBlock</code>s--to identify
code branches, and injects additional <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/enum.StatementKind.html#variant.Coverage"><code>Coverage</code></a>
statements into the <code>BasicBlock</code>s.</p>
<p>A MIR <code>Coverage</code> statement is a virtual instruction that indicates a counter
should be incremented when its adjacent statements are executed, to count
a span of code (<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/coverage/struct.CodeRegion.html"><code>CodeRegion</code></a>). It counts the number of times a
branch is executed, and also specifies the exact location of that code span in
the Rust source code.</p>
<p>Note that many of these <code>Coverage</code> statements will <em>not</em> be converted into
physical counters (or any other executable instructions) in the final binary.
Some of them will be (see <code>CoverageKind::</code><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/coverage/enum.CoverageKind.html#variant.Counter"><code>Counter</code></a>),
but other counters can be computed on the fly, when generating a coverage
report, by mapping a <code>CodeRegion</code> to a
<code>CoverageKind</code>::<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_middle/mir/coverage/enum.CoverageKind.html#variant.Expression"><code>Expression</code></a>.</p>
<p>As an example:</p>
<pre><pre class="playground"><code class="language-rust"><span class="boring">#![allow(unused)]
</span><span class="boring">fn main() {
</span>fn some_func(flag: bool) {
    // increment Counter(1)
    ...
    if flag {
        // increment Counter(2)
        ...
    } else {
        // count = Expression(1) = Counter(1) - Counter(2)
        ...
    }
    // count = Expression(2) = Counter(1) + Zero
    //     or, alternatively, Expression(2) = Counter(2) + Expression(1)
    ...
}
<span class="boring">}
</span></code></pre></pre>
<p>In this example, four contiguous code regions are counted while only
incrementing two counters.</p>
<p>CFG analysis is used to not only determine <em>where</em> the branches are, for
conditional expressions like <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, <code>match</code>, and <code>loop</code>, but also to
determine where expressions can be used in place of physical counters.</p>
<p>The advantages of optimizing coverage through expressions are more pronounced
with loops. Loops generally include at least one conditional branch that
determines when to break out of a loop (a <code>while</code> condition, or an <code>if</code> or
<code>match</code> with a <code>break</code>). In MIR, this is typically lowered to a <code>SwitchInt</code>,
with one branch to stay in the loop, and another branch to break out of the
loop. The branch that breaks out will almost always execute less often,
so <code>InstrumentCoverage</code> chooses to add a <code>Counter</code> to that branch, and an
<code>Expression(continue) = Counter(loop) - Counter(break)</code> to the branch that
continues.</p>
<p>The <code>InstrumentCoverage</code> MIR pass is documented in

<p>When finalizing the coverage map, <code>FunctionCoverage</code> only has the <code>CodeRegion</code>s
and counters for the functions that went through codegen; such as public
functions and &quot;used&quot; functions (functions referenced by other &quot;used&quot; or public
items). Any other functions (considered unused) were still parsed and processed
through the MIR stage.</p>
<p>The set of unused functions is computed via the set difference of all MIR
<code>DefId</code>s (<code>tcx</code> query <code>mir_keys</code>) minus the codegenned <code>DefId</code>s (<code>tcx</code> query
<code>codegened_and_inlined_items</code>). <code>add_unused_functions()</code> computes the set of
unused functions, queries the <code>tcx</code> for the previously-computed <code>CodeRegions</code>,
for each unused MIR, synthesizes an LLVM function (with no internal statements,
since it will not be called), and adds a new <code>FunctionCoverage</code>, with
<code>Unreachable</code> code regions.</p>
<h2 id="testing-llvm-coverage"><a class="header" href="#testing-llvm-coverage">Testing LLVM Coverage</a></h2>
<p>Coverage instrumentation in the MIR is validated by a <code>mir-opt</code> test:

<p>More complete testing of end-to-end coverage instrumentation and reports are

<p>The <code>CoverageGraph</code> is a coverage-specific simplification of the MIR control
flow graph (CFG). Its nodes are <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_transform/coverage/graph/struct.BasicCoverageBlock.html"><code>BasicCoverageBlock</code>s</a>, which
encompass one or more sequentially-executed MIR <code>BasicBlock</code>s
(with no internal branching), plus a <code>CoverageKind</code> counter (to
be added, via coverage analysis), and an optional set of additional counters
to count incoming edges (if there are more than one).</p>
<p>The <code>Instrumentor</code>'s <code>inject_counters()</code> uses the <code>CoverageGraph</code> to
compute the best places to inject coverage counters, as MIR <code>Statement</code>s,
with the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Depending on the debugging configurations in <code>rustc</code>'s, <code>config.toml</code>,
and <code>rustc</code> command line flags, various debugging features may be enabled
to enhance <code>debug!()</code> messages in logs, and to generate various &quot;dump&quot; files,
to help developers understand the MIR transformation process for coverage.
Most of the debugging features are implemented in the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_transform/coverage/debug"><code>debug</code></a>
sub-module.</li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_transform/coverage/spans/struct.CoverageSpans.html#method.generate_coverage_spans"><code>generate_coverage_spans()</code></a> computes the minimum set of distinct,
non-branching code regions, from the MIR. These <code>CoverageSpan</code>s
represent a span of code that must be counted.</li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_transform/coverage/counters/struct.BcbCounters.html#method.make_bcb_counters"><code>make_bcb_counters()</code></a> generates <code>CoverageKind::Counter</code>s and

<code>intermediate_expressions</code><sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#intermediate-expressions">2</a></sup>, not associated with any <code>CodeRegion</code>, but
are required to compute a final <code>Expression</code> value for a <code>CodeRegion</code>.</li>
<li>Inject the new counters into the MIR, as new <code>StatementKind::Coverage</code>
statements. This is done by three distinct functions:
<ul>
<li><code>inject_coverage_span_counters()</code></li>
<li><code>inject_indirect_counters()</code></li>
<li><code>inject_intermediate_expression()</code>, called for each intermediate expression
returned from <code>make_bcb_counters()</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="intermediate-expressions"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">2</sup>
<p>Intermediate expressions are sometimes required
because <code>Expression</code>s are limited to binary additions or subtractions. For
example, <code>A + (B - C)</code> might represent an <code>Expression</code> count computed from three
other counters, <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, and <code>C</code>, but computing that value requires an
intermediate expression for <code>B - C</code>.</p>

<p><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_transform/coverage/graph/struct.CoverageGraph.html#method.compute_basic_coverage_blocks"><code>compute_basic_coverage_blocks()</code></a> builds the
<code>CoverageGraph</code> as a coverage-specific simplification of the MIR CFG. In
contrast with the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_transform/simplify/struct.SimplifyCfg.html"><code>SimplifyCfg</code></a> MIR pass, this step does
not alter the MIR itself, because the <code>CoverageGraph</code> aggressively simplifies
the CFG, and ignores nodes that are not relevant to coverage. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The BCB CFG ignores (excludes) branches considered not relevant
to the current coverage solution. It excludes unwind-related code<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#78544">3</a></sup>
that is injected by the Rust compiler but has no physical source
code to count, which allows a <code>Call</code>-terminated BasicBlock
to be merged with its successor, within a single BCB.</li>
<li>A <code>Goto</code>-terminated <code>BasicBlock</code> can be merged with its successor
<strong><em>as long as</em></strong> it has the only incoming edge to the successor
<code>BasicBlock</code>.</li>
<li>Some BasicBlock terminators support Rust-specific concerns--like
borrow-checking--that are not relevant to coverage analysis. <code>FalseUnwind</code>,
for example, can be treated the same as a <code>Goto</code> (potentially merged with
its successor into the same BCB).</li>
</ul>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="78544"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">3</sup>
<p>(Note, however, that Issue <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/78544">#78544</a> considers
providing future support for coverage of programs that intentionally
<code>panic</code>, as an option, with some non-trivial cost.)</p>
</div>
<p>The BCB CFG is critical to simplifying the coverage analysis by ensuring graph path-based
queries (<code>is_dominated_by()</code>, <code>predecessors</code>, <code>successors</code>, etc.) have branch (control flow)
significance.</p>
<p>To visualize the <code>CoverageGraph</code>, you can generate a <em>graphviz</em> <code>*.dot</code>
file with the following <code>rustc</code> flags:<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#graphviz-dark-mode">4</a></sup></p>
<div class="footnote-definition" id="graphviz-dark-mode"><sup class="footnote-definition-label">4</sup>
<p>This image also applies <code>-Z graphviz-dark-mode</code>, to
produce a Graphviz document with &quot;dark mode&quot; styling. If you use a dark mode or
theme in your development environment, you will probably want to use this
option so you can review the graphviz output without straining your vision.</p>
</div>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ rustc -C instrument-coverage -Z dump-mir=InstrumentCoverage \
    -Z dump-mir-graphviz some_rust_source.rs
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>-Z dump-mir</code> flag requests <a href="mir/debugging.html">MIR debugging
output</a> (generating <code>*.mir</code> files, by default).
<code>-Z dump-mir-graphviz</code> additionally generates <code>*.dot</code> files.
<code>-Z dump-mir=InstrumentCoverage</code> restricts these files to the
<code>InstrumentCoverage</code> pass. All files are written to the <code>./mir_dump/</code>
directory, by default.</p>
<p>Files with names ending in <code>.-------.InstrumentCoverage.0.dot</code> contain the
<em>graphviz</em> representations of a <code>CoverageGraph</code> (one for each MIR, that is,
for each function and closure):</p>
<p><img alt="cropped image of a sample CoverageGraph in graphviz format"

<br/></p>
<p>This image shows each <code>BasicCoverageBlock</code> as a rectangular <em>node</em>, with
directional edges (the arrows) leading from each node to its <code>successors()</code>.
The nodes contain information in sections:</p>
<ol>
<li>The gray header has a label showing the BCB ID (or <em>index</em> for looking up
its <code>BasicCoverageBlockData</code>).</li>
<li>The first content section shows the assigned <code>Counter</code> or <code>Expression</code> for
each contiguous section of code. (There may be more than one <code>Expression</code>
incremented by the same <code>Counter</code> for noncontiguous sections of code
representing the same sequential actions.) Note the code is represented by
the line and column ranges (for example: <code>52:28-52:33</code>, representing the
original source line 52, for columns 28-33). These are followed by the MIR
<code>Statement</code> or <code>Terminator</code> represented by that source range. (How these
coverage regions are determined is discussed in the following section.)</li>
<li>The final section(s) show the MIR <code>BasicBlock</code>s (by ID/index and its
<code>TerminatorKind</code>) contained in this BCB. The last BCB is separated out
because its <code>successors()</code> determine the edges leading out of the BCB, and
into the <code>leading_bb()</code> (first <code>BasicBlock</code>) of each successor BCB.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note, to find the <code>BasicCoverageBlock</code> from a final BCB <code>Terminator</code>'s
successor <code>BasicBlock</code>, there is an index and helper
function--<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_transform/coverage/graph/struct.CoverageGraph.html#method.bcb_from_bb"><code>bcb_from_bb()</code></a>--to look up a <code>BasicCoverageBlock</code> from
<em>any</em> contained <code>BasicBlock</code>.</p>
<h3 id="coveragespans"><a class="header" href="#coveragespans"><code>CoverageSpans</code></a></h3>
<p>The <code>struct</code> <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_transform/coverage/spans/struct.CoverageSpans.html"><code>CoverageSpans</code></a> builds and refines a final set of
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_transform/coverage/spans/struct.CoverageSpan.html"><code>CoverageSpan</code></a>s, each representing the largest contiguous <code>Span</code>
of source within a single BCB. By definition--since each <code>Span</code> falls within a
BCB, the <code>Span</code> is also non-branching; so if any code in that <code>Span</code> has executed,
all code in the <code>Span</code> will have executed, the same number of times.</p>
<p><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_transform/coverage/spans/struct.CoverageSpans.html#method.generate_coverage_spans"><code>CoverageSpans::generate_coverage_spans()</code></a> constructs
an initial set of <code>CoverageSpan</code>s from the <code>Span</code>s associated with each MIR
<code>Statement</code> and <code>Terminator</code>.</p>
<p>The final stage of <code>generate_coverage_spans()</code> is handled by
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_transform/coverage/spans/struct.CoverageSpans.html#method.to_refined_spans"><code>to_refined_spans()</code></a>, which iterates through the <code>CoverageSpan</code>s,
merges and de-duplicates them, and returns an optimal, minimal set of <code>CoverageSpan</code>s
that can be used to assign coverage <code>Counter</code>s or <code>Expression</code>s, one-for-one.</p>
<p>An visual, interactive representation of the final <code>CoverageSpan</code>s can be
generated with the following <code>rustc</code> flags:</p>
<pre><code class="language-shell">$ rustc -C instrument-coverage -Z dump-mir=InstrumentCoverage \
    -Z dump-mir-spanview some_rust_source.rs
</code></pre>
<p>These flags request Spanview output for the <code>InstrumentCoverage</code> pass, and the
resulting files (one for each MIR, that is, for each function or closure) can be
found in the <code>mir_dump</code> directory (by default), with the extension:
<code>.-------.InstrumentCoverage.0.html</code>.</p>
<p><img alt="cropped image of a sample Spanview in a browser"
 src="img/coverage-spanview-01.png" style="border: 1px solid gray" class="center"/>
<br/></p>
<p>The image above shows one such example. The orange and blue backgrounds
highlight alternating <code>CoverageSpan</code>s from the refined set. Hovering over a
line expands the output on that line to show the MIR <code>BasicBlock</code> IDs covered
by each <code>CoverageSpan</code>. While hovering, the <code>CoverageSpan</code> under the pointer
also has a <em>tooltip</em> block of text, showing even more detail, including the
MIR <code>Statement</code>s and <code>Terminator</code>s contributing to the <code>CoverageSpan</code>, and
their individual <code>Span</code>s (which should be encapsulated within the code region
of the refined <code>CoverageSpan</code>)</p>
<h3 id="make_bcb_counters"><a class="header" href="#make_bcb_counters"><code>make_bcb_counters()</code></a></h3>
<p><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_transform/coverage/counters/struct.BcbCounters.html#method.make_bcb_counters"><code>make_bcb_counters()</code></a> traverses the <code>CoverageGraph</code> and adds a
<code>Counter</code> or <code>Expression</code> to every BCB. It uses <em>Control Flow Analysis</em>
to determine where an <code>Expression</code> can be used in place of a <code>Counter</code>.
<code>Expressions</code> have no runtime overhead, so if a viable expression (adding or
subtracting two other counters or expressions) can compute the same result as
an embedded counter, an <code>Expression</code> is preferred.</p>
<p><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_transform/coverage/graph/struct.TraverseCoverageGraphWithLoops.html"><code>TraverseCoverageGraphWithLoops</code></a>
provides a traversal order that ensures all <code>BasicCoverageBlock</code> nodes in a
loop are visited before visiting any node outside that loop. The traversal
state includes a <code>context_stack</code>, with the current loop's context information
(if in a loop), as well as context for nested loops.</p>
<p>Within loops, nodes with multiple outgoing edges (generally speaking, these
are BCBs terminated in a <code>SwitchInt</code>) can be optimized when at least one
branch exits the loop and at least one branch stays within the loop. (For an
<code>if</code> or <code>while</code>, there are only two branches, but a <code>match</code> may have more.)</p>
<p>A branch that does not exit the loop should be counted by <code>Expression</code>, if
possible. Note that some situations require assigning counters to BCBs before
they are visited by traversal, so the <code>counter_kind</code> (<code>CoverageKind</code> for
a <code>Counter</code> or <code>Expression</code>) may have already been assigned, in which case
one of the other branches should get the <code>Expression</code>.</p>
<p>For a node with more than two branches (such as for more than two
<code>match</code> patterns), only one branch can be optimized by <code>Expression</code>. All
others require a <code>Counter</code> (unless its BCB <code>counter_kind</code> was previously
assigned).</p>
<p>A branch expression is derived from the equation:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Counter(branching_node) = SUM(Counter(branches))
</code></pre>
<p>It's important to
be aware that the <code>branches</code> in this equation are the outgoing <em>edges</em>
from the <code>branching_node</code>, but a <code>branch</code>'s target node may have other
incoming edges. Given the following graph, for example, the count for
<code>B</code> is the sum of its two incoming edges:</p>
<p><img alt="Example graph with multiple incoming edges to a branch node"
 src="img/coverage-branch-counting-01.png" class="center" style="width: 25%">
<br/></p>
<p>In this situation, BCB node <code>B</code> may require an edge counter for its
&quot;edge from A&quot;, and that edge might be computed from an <code>Expression</code>,
<code>Counter(A) - Counter(C)</code>. But an expression for the BCB <em>node</em> <code>B</code>
would be the sum of all incoming edges:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">Expression((Counter(A) - Counter(C)) + SUM(Counter(remaining_edges)))
</code></pre>
<p>Note that this is only one possible configuration. The actual choice
of <code>Counter</code> vs. <code>Expression</code> also depends on the order of counter
assignments, and whether a BCB or incoming edge counter already has
its <code>Counter</code> or <code>Expression</code>.</p>
<h3 id="injecting-counters-into-a-mir-basicblock"><a class="header" href="#injecting-counters-into-a-mir-basicblock">Injecting counters into a MIR <code>BasicBlock</code></a></h3>
<p>With the refined <code>CoverageSpan</code>s, and after all <code>Counter</code>s and <code>Expression</code>s are
created, the final step is to inject the <code>StatementKind::Coverage</code> statements
into the MIR. There are three distinct sources, handled by the following
functions:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_transform/coverage/struct.Instrumentor.html#method.inject_coverage_span_counters"><code>inject_coverage_span_counters()</code></a> injects the
counter from each <code>CoverageSpan</code>'s BCB.</li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_transform/coverage/struct.Instrumentor.html#method.inject_indirect_counters"><code>inject_indirect_counters()</code></a> injects counters
for any BCB not assigned to a <code>CoverageSpan</code>, and for all edge counters.
These counters don't have <code>CoverageSpan</code>s.</li>
<li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_mir_transform/coverage/fn.inject_intermediate_expression.html"><code>inject_intermediate_expression()</code></a> injects
the intermediate expressions returned from <code>make_bcb_counters()</code>. These
counters aren't associated with any BCB, edge, or <code>CoverageSpan</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>These three functions inject the <code>Coverage</code> statements into the MIR.
<code>Counter</code>s and <code>Expression</code>s with <code>CoverageSpan</code>s add <code>Coverage</code> statements
to a corresponding <code>BasicBlock</code>, with a <code>CodeRegion</code> computed from the
refined <code>Span</code> and current <code>SourceMap</code>.</p>
<p>All other <code>Coverage</code> statements have a <code>CodeRegion</code> of <code>None</code>, but they
still must be injected because they contribute to other <code>Expression</code>s.</p>
<p>Finally, edge's with a <code>CoverageKind::Counter</code> require a new <code>BasicBlock</code>,
so the counter is only incremented when traversing the branch edge.</p>

<h2 id="how-are-sanitizers-implemented-in-rustc"><a class="header" href="#how-are-sanitizers-implemented-in-rustc">How are sanitizers implemented in rustc?</a></h2>
<p>The implementation of sanitizers (except CFI) relies almost entirely on LLVM.
The rustc is an integration point for LLVM compile time instrumentation passes
and runtime libraries. Highlight of the most important aspects of the
implementation:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The sanitizer runtime libraries are part of the <a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/compiler-rt">compiler-rt</a> project, and
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/1.55.0/src/bootstrap/native.rs#L700-L765">will be built</a> on <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/1.55.0/src/bootstrap/native.rs#L806-L820">supported targets</a>
when enabled in <code>config.toml</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-toml">[build]
sanitizers = true
</code></pre>
<p>The runtimes are <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/1.55.0/src/bootstrap/compile.rs#L376-L407">placed into target libdir</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During LLVM code generation, the functions intended for instrumentation are
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/1.55.0/compiler/rustc_codegen_llvm/src/attributes.rs#L42-L58">marked</a> with appropriate LLVM attribute:
<code>SanitizeAddress</code>, <code>SanitizeHWAddress</code>, <code>SanitizeMemory</code>, or
<code>SanitizeThread</code>. By default all functions are instrumented, but this
behaviour can be changed with <code>#[no_sanitize(...)]</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The decision whether to perform instrumentation or not is possible only at a
function granularity. In the cases were those decision differ between
functions it might be necessary to inhibit inlining, both at <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/1.55.0/compiler/rustc_mir/src/transform/inline.rs#L314-L316">MIR
level</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/llvm-project/blob/9330ec5a4c1df5fc1fa62f993ed6a04da68cb040/llvm/include/llvm/IR/Attributes.td#L225-L241">LLVM level</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The LLVM IR generated by rustc is instrumented by <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/1.55.0/compiler/rustc_codegen_llvm/src/back/write.rs#L660-L678">dedicated LLVM
passes</a>, different for each sanitizer. Instrumentation
passes are invoked after optimization passes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When producing an executable, the sanitizer specific runtime library is
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/1.55.0/compiler/rustc_codegen_ssa/src/back/link.rs#L1053-L1089">linked in</a>. The libraries are searched for in the target
libdir. First relative to the overridden system root and subsequently
relative to the default system root. Fall-back to the default system root
ensures that sanitizer runtimes remain available when using sysroot overrides
constructed by cargo <code>-Z build-std</code> or xargo.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="testing-sanitizers"><a class="header" href="#testing-sanitizers">Testing sanitizers</a></h2>
<p>Sanitizers are validated by code generation tests in
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/tests/codegen"><code>tests/codegen/sanitize*.rs</code></a> and end-to-end functional tests in
<a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/tests/ui/sanitize"><code>tests/ui/sanitize/</code></a> directory.</p>
<p>Testing sanitizer functionality requires the sanitizer runtimes (built when
<code>sanitizer = true</code> in <code>config.toml</code>) and target providing support for particular
sanitizer. When sanitizer is unsupported on given target, sanitizers tests will
be ignored. This behaviour is controlled by compiletest <code>needs-sanitizer-*</code>
directives.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugger">debugger or debugging tool</a> is a computer program that is used to test and debug
other programs (the &quot;target&quot; program).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Writing a debugger from scratch for a language requires a lot of work, especially if
debuggers have to be supported on various platforms. GDB and LLDB, however, can be
extended to support debugging a language. This is the path that Rust has chosen.
This document's main goal is to document the said debuggers support in Rust compiler.</p>
<h3 id="dwarf"><a class="header" href="#dwarf">DWARF</a></h3>
<p>According to the <a href="http://dwarfstd.org">DWARF</a> standard website</p>
<blockquote>
<p>DWARF is a debugging file format used by many compilers and debuggers to support source level
debugging. It addresses the requirements of a number of procedural languages,
such as C, C++, and Fortran, and is designed to be extensible to other languages.
DWARF is architecture independent and applicable to any processor or operating system.
It is widely used on Unix, Linux and other operating systems,
as well as in stand-alone environments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>DWARF reader is a program that consumes the DWARF format and creates debugger compatible output.
This program may live in the compiler itself.  DWARF uses a data structure called
Debugging Information Entry (DIE) which stores the information as &quot;tags&quot; to denote functions,
variables etc., e.g., <code>DW_TAG_variable</code>, <code>DW_TAG_pointer_type</code>, <code>DW_TAG_subprogram</code> etc.
You can also invent your own tags and attributes.</p>
<h3 id="codeviewpdb"><a class="header" href="#codeviewpdb">CodeView/PDB</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://llvm.org/docs/PDB/index.html">PDB</a> (Program Database) is a file format created by Microsoft that contains debug information.
PDBs can be consumed by debuggers such as WinDbg/CDB and other tools to display debug information.
A PDB contains multiple streams that describe debug information about a specific binary such
as types, symbols, and source files used to compile the given binary. CodeView is another
format which defines the structure of <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/PDB/CodeViewSymbols.html">symbol records</a> and <a href="https://llvm.org/docs/PDB/CodeViewTypes.html">type records</a> that appear within
PDB streams.</p>

<h3 id="gdb"><a class="header" href="#gdb">GDB</a></h3>
<h4 id="rust-expression-parser"><a class="header" href="#rust-expression-parser">Rust expression parser</a></h4>
<p>To be able to show debug output, we need an expression parser.
This (GDB) expression parser is written in <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/">Bison</a>,
and can parse only a subset of Rust expressions.
GDB parser was written from scratch and has no relation to any other parser,
including that of rustc.</p>
<p>GDB has Rust-like value and type output. It can print values and types in a way
that look like Rust syntax in the output. Or when you print a type as <a href="https://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/gdb/html_node/gdb_109.html">ptype</a> in GDB,
it also looks like Rust source code. Checkout the documentation in the <a href="https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Rust.html">manual for GDB/Rust</a>.</p>
<h4 id="parser-extensions"><a class="header" href="#parser-extensions">Parser extensions</a></h4>
<p>Expression parser has a couple of extensions in it to facilitate features that you cannot do
with Rust. Some limitations are listed in the <a href="https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Rust.html">manual for GDB/Rust</a>. There is some special
code in the DWARF reader in GDB to support the extensions.</p>
<p>A couple of examples of DWARF reader support needed are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Enum: Needed for support for enum types.
The Rust compiler writes the information about enum into DWARF,
and GDB reads the DWARF to understand where is the tag field,
or if there is a tag field,
or if the tag slot is shared with non-zero optimization etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dissect trait objects: DWARF extension where the trait object's description in the DWARF
also points to a stub description of the corresponding vtable which in turn points to the
concrete type for which this trait object exists. This means that you can do a <code>print *object</code>
for that trait object, and GDB will understand how to find the correct type of the payload in
the trait object.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Microsoft provides <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/">Windows Debugging Tools</a> such as the Windows Debugger (WinDbg) and
the Console Debugger (CDB) which both support debugging programs written in Rust. These
debuggers parse the debug info for a binary from the <code>PDB</code>, if available, to construct a
visualization to serve up in the debugger.</p>
<h4 id="natvis"><a class="header" href="#natvis">Natvis</a></h4>
<p>Both WinDbg and CDB support defining and viewing custom visualizations for any given type
within the debugger using the Natvis framework. The Rust compiler defines a set of Natvis
files that define custom visualizations for a subset of types in the standard libraries such
as, <code>std</code>, <code>core</code>, and <code>alloc</code>. These Natvis files are embedded into <code>PDBs</code> generated by the
<code>*-pc-windows-msvc</code> target triples to automatically enable these custom visualizations when
debugging. This default can be overridden by setting the <code>strip</code> rustc flag to either <code>debuginfo</code>
or <code>symbols</code>.</p>
<p>Rust has support for embedding Natvis files for crates outside of the standard libraries by
using the <code>#[debugger_visualizer]</code> attribute.
For more details on how to embed debugger visualizers,
please refer to the <code>#[debugger_visualizer]</code> attribute in

<h2 id="dwarf-and-rustc"><a class="header" href="#dwarf-and-rustc">DWARF and <code>rustc</code></a></h2>
<p><a href="http://dwarfstd.org">DWARF</a> is the standard way compilers generate debugging information that debuggers read.
It is <em>the</em> debugging format on macOS and Linux.
It is a multi-language and extensible format,
and is mostly good enough for Rust's purposes.
Hence, the current implementation reuses DWARF's concepts.
This is true even if some of the concepts in DWARF do not align with Rust semantically because,
generally, there can be some kind of mapping between the two.</p>
<p>We have some DWARF extensions that the Rust compiler emits and the debuggers understand that
are <em>not</em> in the DWARF standard.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Rust compiler will emit DWARF for a virtual table, and this <code>vtable</code> object will have a
<code>DW_AT_containing_type</code> that points to the real type. This lets debuggers dissect a trait object
pointer to correctly find the payload. E.g., here's such a DIE, from a test case in the gdb
repository:</p>
<pre><code class="language-asm">&lt;1&gt;&lt;1a9&gt;: Abbrev Number: 3 (DW_TAG_structure_type)
   &lt;1aa&gt;   DW_AT_containing_type: &lt;0x1b4&gt;
   &lt;1ae&gt;   DW_AT_name        : (indirect string, offset: 0x23d): vtable
   &lt;1b2&gt;   DW_AT_byte_size   : 0
   &lt;1b3&gt;   DW_AT_alignment   : 8
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>The other extension is that the Rust compiler can emit a tagless discriminated union.
See <a href="http://dwarfstd.org/ShowIssue.php?issue=180517.2">DWARF feature request</a> for this item.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="current-limitations-of-dwarf"><a class="header" href="#current-limitations-of-dwarf">Current limitations of DWARF</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Traits - require a bigger change than normal to DWARF, on how to represent Traits in DWARF.</li>
<li>DWARF provides no way to differentiate between Structs and Tuples. Rust compiler emits
fields with <code>__0</code> and debuggers look for a sequence of such names to overcome this limitation.
For example, in this case the debugger would look at a field via <code>x.__0</code> instead of <code>x.0</code>.
This is resolved via the Rust parser in the debugger so now you can do <code>x.0</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>DWARF relies on debuggers to know some information about platform ABI.
Rust does not do that all the time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>System Integrity Protection (SIP, sometimes referred to as rootless) is a security feature
of Apple's macOS operating system introduced in OS X El Capitan. It comprises a number of
mechanisms that are enforced by the kernel. A centerpiece is the protection of system-owned
files and directories against modifications by processes without a specific &quot;entitlement&quot;,
even when executed by the root user or a user with root privileges (sudo).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It prevents processes using <code>ptrace</code> syscall. If a process wants to use <code>ptrace</code> it has to be
code signed. The certificate that signs it has to be trusted on your machine.</p>

<p>We may need to sign up with Apple and get the keys to do this signing. Tom has looked into if
Mozilla cannot do this because it is at the maximum number of
keys it is allowed to sign. Tom does not know if Mozilla could get more keys.</p>
<p>Alternatively, Tom suggests that maybe a Rust legal entity is needed to get the keys via Apple.
This problem is not technical in nature. If we had such a key we could sign GDB as well and
ship that.</p>
<h3 id="dwarf-and-traits"><a class="header" href="#dwarf-and-traits">DWARF and Traits</a></h3>
<p>Rust traits are not emitted into DWARF at all. The impact of this is calling a method <code>x.method()</code>
does not work as is. The reason being that method is implemented by a trait, as opposed
to a type. That information is not present so finding trait methods is missing.</p>
<p>DWARF has a notion of interface types (possibly added for Java). Tom's idea was to use this
interface type as traits.</p>
<p>DWARF only deals with concrete names, not the reference types. So, a given implementation of a
trait for a type would be one of these interfaces (<code>DW_tag_interface</code> type). Also, the type for
which it is implemented would describe all the interfaces this type implements. This requires a
DWARF extension.</p>

<p>LLVM has Debug Info (DI) builders. This is the primary thing that Rust calls into.
This is why we need to change LLVM first because that is emitted first and not DWARF directly.
This is a kind of metadata that you construct and hand-off to LLVM. For the Rustc/LLVM hand-off
some LLVM DI builder methods are called to construct representation of a type.</p>
<p>The steps of this process are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can emit location of the invocation of the macro.</li>
<li>You can emit the location of the definition of the macro.</li>
<li>You can emit locations of the content of the macro.</li>
</ul>
<p>RFC: <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2117">https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2117</a></p>

set the breakpoints and what happens when you step it.</p>
<h2 id="source-file-checksums-in-debug-info"><a class="header" href="#source-file-checksums-in-debug-info">Source file checksums in debug info</a></h2>
<p>Both DWARF and CodeView (PDB) support embedding a cryptographic hash of each source file that
contributed to the associated binary.</p>
<p>The cryptographic hash can be used by a debugger to verify that the source file matches the
executable. If the source file does not match, the debugger can provide a warning to the user.</p>
<p>The hash can also be used to prove that a given source file has not been modified since it was
used to compile an executable. Because MD5 and SHA1 both have demonstrated vulnerabilities,
using SHA256 is recommended for this application.</p>
<p>The Rust compiler stores the hash for each source file in the corresponding <code>SourceFile</code> in
the <code>SourceMap</code>. The hashes of input files to external crates are stored in <code>rlib</code> metadata.</p>
<p>A default hashing algorithm is set in the target specification. This allows the target to
specify the best hash available, since not all targets support all hash algorithms.</p>
<p>The hashing algorithm for a target can also be overridden with the <code>-Z source-file-checksum=</code>

<p>This is an important idea because debuggers by and large do not try to implement type
inference. You need to be much more explicit when you type into the debugger than your
actual source code. So, you cannot just copy and paste an expression from your source
code to debugger and expect the same answer but this would be nice. This can be helped
by using compiler.</p>
<p>It is certainly doable but it is a large project. You certainly need a bridge to the
debugger because the debugger alone has access to the memory. Both GDB (gcc) and LLDB (clang)
have this feature. LLDB uses Clang to compile code to JIT and GDB can do the same with GCC.</p>
<p>Both debuggers expression evaluation implement both a superset and a subset of Rust.
They implement just the expression language,
but they also add some extensions like GDB has convenience variables.
Therefore, if you are taking this route,
then you not only need to do this bridge,
but may have to add some mode to let the compiler understand some extensions.</p>

<p>This section covers a numbers of common compiler terms that arise in
this guide. We try to give the general definition while providing some
Rust-specific context.</p>
<p><a name="cfg"></a></p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-control-flow-graph"><a class="header" href="#what-is-a-control-flow-graph">What is a control-flow graph?</a></h2>
<p>A control-flow graph (CFG) is a common term from compilers. If you've ever
used a flow-chart, then the concept of a control-flow graph will be
pretty familiar to you. It's a representation of your program that
clearly exposes the underlying control flow.</p>
<p>A control-flow graph is structured as a set of <strong>basic blocks</strong>
connected by edges. The key idea of a basic block is that it is a set
of statements that execute &quot;together&quot; – that is, whenever you branch
to a basic block, you start at the first statement and then execute
all the remainder. Only at the end of the block is there the
possibility of branching to more than one place (in MIR, we call that
final statement the <strong>terminator</strong>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-mir">bb0: {
    statement0;
    statement1;
    statement2;
    ...
    terminator;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Many expressions that you are used to in Rust compile down to multiple
basic blocks. For example, consider an if statement:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">a = 1;
if some_variable {
    b = 1;
} else {
    c = 1;
}
d = 1;
</code></pre>
<p>This would compile into four basic blocks in MIR. In textual form, it looks like
this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-mir">BB0: {
    a = 1;
    if some_variable {
        goto BB1;
    } else {
        goto BB2;
    }
}

BB1: {
    b = 1;
    goto BB3;
}

BB2: {
    c = 1;
    goto BB3;
}

BB3: {
    d = 1;
    ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>In graphical form, it looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>                BB0
       +--------------------+
       | a = 1;             |
       +--------------------+
             /       \
  if some_variable   else
           /           \
     BB1  /             \  BB2
    +-----------+   +-----------+
    | b = 1;    |   | c = 1;    |
    +-----------+   +-----------+
            \          /
             \        /
              \ BB3  /
            +----------+
            | d = 1;   |
            | ...      |
            +----------+
</code></pre>
<p>When using a control-flow graph, a loop simply appears as a cycle in
the graph, and the <code>break</code> keyword translates into a path out of that
cycle.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-dataflow-analysis"><a class="header" href="#what-is-a-dataflow-analysis">What is a dataflow analysis?</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://cs.au.dk/~amoeller/spa/"><em>Static Program Analysis</em></a> by Anders Møller
and Michael I. Schwartzbach is an incredible resource!</p>
<p><em>Dataflow analysis</em> is a type of static analysis that is common in many
compilers. It describes a general technique, rather than a particular analysis.</p>
<p>The basic idea is that we can walk over a <a href="appendix/background.html#cfg">control-flow graph (CFG)</a> and
keep track of what some value could be. At the end of the walk, we might have
shown that some claim is true or not necessarily true (e.g. &quot;this variable must
be initialized&quot;). <code>rustc</code> tends to do dataflow analyses over the MIR, since MIR
is already a CFG.</p>
<p>For example, suppose we want to check that <code>x</code> is initialized before it is used
in this snippet:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn foo() {
    let mut x;

    if some_cond {
        x = 1;
    }

    dbg!(x);
}
</code></pre>
<p>A CFG for this code might look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-txt"> +------+
 | Init | (A)
 +------+
    |   \
    |   if some_cond
  else    \ +-------+
    |      \| x = 1 | (B)
    |       +-------+
    |      /
 +---------+
 | dbg!(x) | (C)
 +---------+
</code></pre>
<p>We can do the dataflow analysis as follows: we will start off with a flag <code>init</code>
which indicates if we know <code>x</code> is initialized. As we walk the CFG, we will
update the flag. At the end, we can check its value.</p>
<p>So first, in block (A), the variable <code>x</code> is declared but not initialized, so
<code>init = false</code>. In block (B), we initialize the value, so we know that <code>x</code> is
initialized. So at the end of (B), <code>init = true</code>.</p>
<p>Block (C) is where things get interesting. Notice that there are two incoming
edges, one from (A) and one from (B), corresponding to whether <code>some_cond</code> is true or not.
But we cannot know that! It could be the case the <code>some_cond</code> is always true,
so that <code>x</code> is actually always initialized. It could also be the case that
<code>some_cond</code> depends on something random (e.g. the time), so <code>x</code> may not be
initialized. In general, we cannot know statically (due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice%27s_theorem">Rice's
Theorem</a>).  So what should the value of <code>init</code> be in block (C)?</p>
<p>Generally, in dataflow analyses, if a block has multiple parents (like (C) in
our example), its dataflow value will be some function of all its parents (and
of course, what happens in (C)).  Which function we use depends on the analysis
we are doing.</p>
<p>In this case, we want to be able to prove definitively that <code>x</code> must be
initialized before use. This forces us to be conservative and assume that
<code>some_cond</code> might be false sometimes. So our &quot;merging function&quot; is &quot;and&quot;. That
is, <code>init = true</code> in (C) if <code>init = true</code> in (A) <em>and</em> in (B) (or if <code>x</code> is
initialized in (C)). But this is not the case; in particular, <code>init = false</code> in
(A), and <code>x</code> is not initialized in (C).  Thus, <code>init = false</code> in (C); we can
report an error that &quot;<code>x</code> may not be initialized before use&quot;.</p>
<p>There is definitely a lot more that can be said about dataflow analyses. There is an
extensive body of research literature on the topic, including a lot of theory.
We only discussed a forwards analysis, but backwards dataflow analysis is also
useful. For example, rather than starting from block (A) and moving forwards,
we might have started with the usage of <code>x</code> and moved backwards to try to find
its initialization.</p>

<li>Traditional notation: ∃x: P(x). Read as &quot;there exists x such that P(x) holds&quot;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In Rust, they come up in type checking and trait solving. For example,</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn foo&lt;T&gt;()
</code></pre>
<p>This function claims that the function is well-typed for all types <code>T</code>: <code>∀ T: well_typed(foo)</code>.</p>
<p>Another example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn foo&lt;'a&gt;(_: &amp;'a usize)
</code></pre>
<p>This function claims that for any lifetime <code>'a</code> (determined by the
caller), it is well-typed: <code>∀ 'a: well_typed(foo)</code>.</p>
<p>Another example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn foo&lt;F&gt;()
where for&lt;'a&gt; F: Fn(&amp;'a u8)
</code></pre>
<p>This function claims that it is well-typed for all types <code>F</code> such that for all
lifetimes <code>'a</code>, <code>F: Fn(&amp;'a u8)</code>: <code>∀ F: ∀ 'a: (F: Fn(&amp;'a u8)) =&gt; well_typed(foo)</code>.</p>
<p>One more example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">fn foo(_: dyn Debug)
</code></pre>
<p>This function claims that there exists some type <code>T</code> that implements <code>Debug</code>
such that the function is well-typed: <code>∃ T:  (T: Debug) and well_typed(foo)</code>.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn_index">De Bruijn indices</a> are a way of representing, using only integers,
which variables are bound in which binders. They were originally invented for
use in lambda calculus evaluation (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Bruijn_index">this Wikipedia article</a> for
more). In <code>rustc</code>, we use de Bruijn indices to <a href="appendix/../generics.html">represent generic types</a>.</p>
<p>Here is a basic example of how de Bruijn indices might be used for closures (we
don't actually do this in <code>rustc</code> though!):</p>
<pre><code class="language-rust ignore">|x| {
    f(x) // de Bruijn index of `x` is 1 because `x` is bound 1 level up

    |y| {
        g(x, y) // index of `x` is 2 because it is bound 2 levels up
                // index of `y` is 1 because it is bound 1 level up
    }
}
</code></pre>

<h2 id="what-is-a-free-region-or-a-free-variable-what-about-bound-region"><a class="header" href="#what-is-a-free-region-or-a-free-variable-what-about-bound-region">What is a &quot;free region&quot; or a &quot;free variable&quot;? What about &quot;bound region&quot;?</a></h2>
<p>Let's describe the concepts of free vs bound in terms of program
variables, since that's the thing we're most familiar with.</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider this expression, which creates a closure: <code>|a, b| a + b</code>.
Here, the <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> in <code>a + b</code> refer to the arguments that the closure will
be given when it is called. We say that the <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> there are <strong>bound</strong> to
the closure, and that the closure signature <code>|a, b|</code> is a <strong>binder</strong> for the
names <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> (because any references to <code>a</code> or <code>b</code> within refer to the
variables that it introduces).</li>
<li>Consider this expression: <code>a + b</code>. In this expression, <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> refer to
local variables that are defined <em>outside</em> of the expression. We say that
those variables <strong>appear free</strong> in the expression (i.e., they are <strong>free</strong>,
not <strong>bound</strong> (tied up)).</li>
</ul>
<p>So there you have it: a variable &quot;appears free&quot; in some
expression/statement/whatever if it refers to something defined
outside of that expressions/statement/whatever. Equivalently, we can
then refer to the &quot;free variables&quot; of an expression – which is just
the set of variables that &quot;appear free&quot;.</p>
<p>So what does this have to do with regions? Well, we can apply the
analogous concept to type and regions. For example, in the type <code>&amp;'a u32</code>, <code>'a</code> appears free.  But in the type <code>for&lt;'a&gt; fn(&amp;'a u32)</code>, it
does not.</p>

These include optimizations like removing functions that are never used in the final program, for example. <em>ThinLTO</em> is a variant of LTO that aims to be a bit more scalable and efficient, but possibly sacrifices some optimizations. You may also read issues in the Rust repo about &quot;FatLTO&quot;, which is the loving nickname given to non-Thin LTO.

<tr><td><span id="memoization">memoization</span>       </td><td>The process of storing the results of (pure) computations (such as pure function calls) to avoid having to repeat them in the future. This is typically a trade-off between execution speed and memory usage.</td></tr>

For example, the <code>NonZero*</code> integers or the reference <code>&amp;T</code> cannot be represented by a 0 bitstring. This means the compiler can perform layout optimizations by taking advantage of the invalid &quot;niche value&quot;. An example application for this is the <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/unsafe-code-guidelines/layout/enums.html#discriminant-elision-on-option-like-enums"><em>Discriminant elision on <code>Option</code>-like enums</em></a>, which allows using a type's niche as the <a href="appendix/glossary.html#tag">&quot;tag&quot;</a> for an <code>enum</code> without requiring a separate field.</td></tr>

<tr><td><span id="query">query</span>                   </td><td>A sub-computation during compilation. Query results can be cached in the current session or to disk for incremental compilation. (<a href="appendix/../query.html">see more</a>)</td></tr>
<tr><td><span id="recovery">recovery</span>             </td><td>Recovery refers to handling invalid syntax during parsing (e.g. a missing comma) and continuing to parse the AST. This avoid showing spurious errors to the user (e.g. showing 'missing field' errors when the struct definition contains errors).</td></tr>
<tr><td><span id="region">region</span>                 </td><td>Another term for &quot;lifetime&quot; often used in the literature and in the borrow checker.</td></tr>

For example, in <code>match x { A =&gt; 1, B =&gt; 2 }</code>, the expression <code>x</code> is the scrutinee.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span id="sess">sess</span>                     </td><td>The compiler session, which stores global data used throughout compilation</td></tr>
<tr><td><span id="side-tables">side tables</span>       </td><td>Because the AST and HIR are immutable once created, we often carry extra information about them in the form of hashtables, indexed by the id of a particular node.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span id="sigil">sigil</span>                   </td><td>Like a keyword but composed entirely of non-alphanumeric tokens. For example, <code>&amp;</code> is a sigil for references.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span id="soundness">soundness</span>           </td><td>A technical term in type theory. Roughly, if a type system is sound, then a program that type-checks is type-safe. That is, one can never (in safe rust) force a value into a variable of the wrong type. (see &quot;completeness&quot;).</td></tr>
<tr><td><span id="span">span</span>                     </td><td>A location in the user's source code, used for error reporting primarily. These are like a file-name/line-number/column tuple on steroids: they carry a start/end point, and also track macro expansions and compiler desugaring. All while being packed into a few bytes (really, it's an index into a table). See the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_span/struct.Span.html"><code>Span</code></a> datatype for more.</td></tr>

<tr><td><span id="tag">tag</span>                       </td><td>The &quot;tag&quot; of an enum/generator encodes the <a href="appendix/glossary.html#discriminant">discriminant</a> of the active variant/state.  Tags can either be &quot;direct&quot; (simply storing the discriminant in a field) or use a <a href="appendix/glossary.html#niche">&quot;niche&quot;</a>.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span id="tcx"><code>tcx</code></span>                     </td><td>Standard variable name for the &quot;typing context&quot; (<code>TyCtxt</code>), main data structure of the compiler. (<a href="appendix/../ty.html">see more</a>)</td></tr>
<tr><td><span id="lifetime-tcx"><code>'tcx</code></span>           </td><td>The lifetime of the allocation arenas used by <code>TyCtxt</code>. Most data interned during a compilation session will use this lifetime with the exception of HIR data which uses the <code>'hir</code> lifetime. (<a href="appendix/../ty.html">see more</a>)</td></tr>
<tr><td><span id="token">token</span>                   </td><td>The smallest unit of parsing. Tokens are produced after lexing (<a href="appendix/../the-parser.html">see more</a>).</td></tr>

Variables may be defined so that each thread has its own copy (rather than all threads sharing the variable). This has some interactions with LLVM. Not all platforms support TLS.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span id="trait-ref">trait reference</span>     </td><td>The name of a trait along with a suitable set of input type/lifetimes. (<a href="appendix/../traits/goals-and-clauses.html#trait-ref">see more</a>)</td></tr>
<tr><td><span id="trans">trans</span>                   </td><td>Short for &quot;translation&quot;, the code to translate MIR into LLVM IR. Renamed to codegen.</td></tr>

<tr><td><span id="tyctxt"><code>TyCtxt</code></span>               </td><td>The data structure often referred to as <a href="appendix/glossary.html#tcx"><code>tcx</code></a> in code which provides access to session data and the query system.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span id="ufcs">UFCS</span>                     </td><td>Short for Universal Function Call Syntax, this is an unambiguous syntax for calling a method. (<a href="appendix/../type-checking.html">see more</a>)</td></tr>
<tr><td><span id="ut">uninhabited type</span>           </td><td>A type which has <em>no</em> values. This is not the same as a ZST, which has exactly 1 value. An example of an uninhabited type is <code>enum Foo {}</code>, which has no variants, and so, can never be created. The compiler can treat code that deals with uninhabited types as dead code, since there is no such value to be manipulated. <code>!</code> (the never type) is an uninhabited type. Uninhabited types are also called &quot;empty types&quot;.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span id="upvar">upvar</span>                   </td><td>A variable captured by a closure from outside the closure.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span id="variance">variance</span>             </td><td>Determines how changes to a generic type/lifetime parameter affect subtyping; for example, if <code>T</code> is a subtype of <code>U</code>, then <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> is a subtype <code>Vec&lt;U&gt;</code> because <code>Vec</code> is <em>covariant</em> in its generic parameter. See <a href="appendix/./background.html#variance">the background chapter</a> for a more general explanation. See the <a href="appendix/../variance.html">variance chapter</a> for an explanation of how type checking handles variance.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span id="variant-idx">variant index</span>     </td><td>In an enum, identifies a variant by assigning them indices starting at 0.  This is purely internal and not to be confused with the <a href="appendix/glossary.html#discriminant">&quot;discriminant&quot;</a> which can be overwritten by the user (e.g. <code>enum Bool { True = 42, False = 0 }</code>).</td></tr>
<tr><td><span id="wide-ptr">wide pointer</span>         </td><td>A pointer with additional metadata. See &quot;fat pointer&quot; for more.</td></tr>
<tr><td><span id="zst">ZST</span>                       </td><td>Zero-Sized Type. A type whose values have size 0 bytes. Since <code>2^0 = 1</code>, such types can have exactly one value. For example, <code>()</code> (unit) is a ZST. <code>struct Foo;</code> is also a ZST. The compiler can do some nice optimizations around ZSTs.</td></tr>
